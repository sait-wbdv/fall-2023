<h2>Vanilla Conditional Review</h2>

- Conditionals are used to return different values based on specific conditions
- use traditional if/else blocks or ternary operators

<h2 id="scrum-meeting">Scrum Session</h2>

- what have you been working on?
- what do you plan to be doing?
- do you have any blocks?
- identify a question regarding svelte or tailwind that your group cannot answer

<h2>Refresh on Component Syntax</h2>

1. Nested Props
2. Slots
3. **Spread Operator**: Use this to pass a whole object to a component (the object **must** map to the component's props)
   - This can really clean up your code when used right
4. Style Props
   - [check out these examples](https://svelte.dev/repl/89053145d4ad440ba4320dd663949d40?version=4.2.2)

**Tutorial Review**

- [Declaring props](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/declaring-props)
- [Default values](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/default-values)
- [Spread props](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/spread-props)

<h2>Conditional Rendering</h2>

- Svelte uses it's own custom if else syntax
- This allows you to render variations based on things like prop values
- [Example: Else If Blocks](https://svelte.dev/examples/else-if-blocks)

### In class Example:

- Render specific images based on conditions

### Activity: Conditional Rendering in Components

- Make a component that renders different content based on prop values
  - ie: `if name === 'Shaggy'` render a picture of a scooby snack, `else` render the mystery machine
  - you could also use numerical values **arguably easier to start**
  - remember the `{:else}` clause
- Render styles differently based a prop boolean:
  - ie: a feature card might be different from an info card in few enough ways to use the same component but with conditional rendering
    - suggestion: set the InfoCard to be a default in the `{:else}` and have the Feature card include a button and more visual prominance or something
    - for the prop, you can do this with a boolean prop
