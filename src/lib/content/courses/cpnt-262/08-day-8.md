## Debugging and Code Warmups

- Various examples using loops and methods

### Morning Activity: Plan out a repeated action

**Focus:** Based on any of your brainstorming activities (or look at live websites), find situations where repetition is necessary

- In small groups, take about 5 minutes to review your past ideas for things that could be looped. **find 1 simple example**
  - _tip: consider sites, apps, or anything that you have interest in building_
- Talk through one another's loops, help consider potential bugs, problems, or code that could be useful
- Take notes on each other feedback
- These can be used in your assignment 4

#### Class Debrief

- Everyone will get a couple minutes to talk about their loops and the elements that are looping

## For Loops

- The traditional Loop
- [Slides](/slides/cpnt-262/js-strings)

### In Class Activity: Render things with loops

1. in a code pen, Log text out in a console with a for loop
2. in the same code pen, render the content onto the web page

## For In Loops

- These can be used to loop through objects

### Activity

1. Create a simple object in a codepen
2. iterate through and render the keys in a console
3. iterate through and render the values in a console
4. iterate through and render both the keys and values onto a page

---

## For Of Loop

- A simpler and more modern for loop

### Activity

- Create an array of objects
- use a for of loop to iterate through the array
- use a for in loop inside the for of loop
- render values from the object to the console
  </LessonPlan>

### End of Day Activity: Recreate Morning Algorithm in JS

- **Focus**: Use [looping syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration), pick loop types that make the most sense with your topic
  - Take the loop idea from the morning and create a minimal example of it rendered onto an html page
