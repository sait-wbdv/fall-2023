<h2>Prep</h2>

- Read [Method definitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Method_definitions)
- Reread [Standard built in objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects)
- Read [how to use object methods](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-object-methods-in-javascript) by Tania Rascia

### Morning Activity: Draft a pitch for the hackathon

- Come up with a few potential things to work on (262-assignment 1 is a good option)
  - pick topics and content focus
  - brainstorm and **ideate**
- **Draft a sayable statement (1-2 sentences) of the problem that you are trying to solve**
  - not code focused, what does the user get out of your app
  - It does not need to be unique. In fact it's a good idea to do something that's got lots of examples to work off of
- If you have time left over, do some research for tutorials, docs, concepts etc.

<h2>1. Object Methods</h2>

[![Object Methods](/images/slides/cpnt-262/js-object-methods)](/slides/cpnt-262/js-object-methods)

### Key Takeaways

- Objects are challenging because you cant loop through them the way you can with arrays
- However if you need to access an object's properties in this way, you can use these methods
- Other object methods can be used to prevent future changes to an object's properties, duplicate an object, and other tasks

---

<h2>2. Creating Object Methods</h2>

- These are different from the methods that we looked at above
  - They work more like array methods instead of accessing the Object constructor
- Objects may need to be able to perform actions themselves
- to do this, you can add functions into the k/v pairs of objects
- gives access to a scoped `this`

```
const obj = {
  propertyOne: "Object Name",
  methodOne () {
    return this.propertyOne
  }
}
```

- You can then run the method like this:

```
console.log(obj.methodOne());
```

<h2>3. Local Storage</h2>
- Store information in the users's browser
- This is useful for understanding how state and advanced features will work

### Advantages and Disadvantages

- Data doesn't expire and can be accessed offline
- more secure than cookie storage
- Greater storage capacity

### Disadvantages

- It's synchronous (things happen 1 at a time)
  - small bits of data, user won't notice but larger amounts could cause a slowdown
- Don't use to store sensitive data
- Data can only be strings
- Too much data will slow down the application

### [Local Storage, Cookies, Session Storage](https://youtu.be/GihQAC1I39Q?si=7K8VCbK_MAyeUgmA)

- Difference between these two ways of storing information

### In Class Demo

- Add persistant storage to a counter

<h2>4. Third Party Libraries</h2>

- Extend your site's functionality with third party libraries.
  - these can reduce the amount of code that you manually have to write
  - this allows you to integrate different features
  - common libraries to use:
    - [Greensock](https://greensock.com/): animation
    - [lodash](https://lodash.com/): utility functions
    - [chartjs](https://www.chartjs.org/): data visualization
    - [momentjs](https://momentjs.com/): manage time and dates effectively
    - [express](https://expressjs.com/): server micro framework
    - [masonry](https://masonry.desandro.com/): cascading grid layout library
    - [Threejs](https://threejs.org/): 3d designs
    - [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com): Tailwind CSS Library

</LessonPlan>

### Activity: Experiment with a library

- Pick a 3rd party library from the abovenoted list
- Follow it's introductory tutorial
- Deploy a github repo featuring your work
