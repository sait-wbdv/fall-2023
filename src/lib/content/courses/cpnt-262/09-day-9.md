<h2>Prep</h2>

- Read [Method definitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Method_definitions)
- Reread [Standard built in objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects)
- Read [how to use object methods](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-object-methods-in-javascript) by Tania Rascia

### Morning Activity: Algorithms in Everyday Life (15 minutes)

**Focus**: Attributes and actions of a person, place, or thing. (ie: a dog barks and runs; but also has fur color, legs etc.)

1. Create a flowchart of something that you enjoy doing using the instructions linked below (15 minutes)
2. Briefly discuss your findings:
   - What activity did you document? What step(s) did you break down into micro steps?
   - **Walk each other through your steps**
   - When broken into micro steps, did you underestimate how complex the activity actually was?

<h2>1. Object Methods</h2>

[![Object Methods](/images/slides/cpnt-262/js-object-methods)](/slides/cpnt-262/js-object-methods)

### Key Takeaways

- Objects are challenging because you cant loop through them the way you can with arrays
- However if you need to access an object's properties in this way, you can use these methods
- Other object methods can be used to prevent future changes to an object's properties, duplicate an object, and other tasks

---

<h2>2. Creating Object Methods</h2>

- These are different from the methods that we looked at above
  - They work more like array methods instead of accessing the Object constructor
- Objects may need to be able to perform actions themselves
- to do this, you can add functions into the k/v pairs of objects
- gives access to a scoped `this`

```
const obj = {
  propertyOne: "Object Name",
  methodOne () {
    return this.propertyOne
  }
}
```

- You can then run the method like this:

```
console.log(obj.methodOne());
```

<h2>3. Third Party Libraries</h2>
- Extend your site's functionality with third party libraries.
  - these can reduce the amount of code that you manually have to write
  - this allows you to integrate different features
  - common libraries to use:
    - [Greensock](https://greensock.com/): animation
    - [lodash](https://lodash.com/): utility functions
    - [chartjs](https://www.chartjs.org/): data visualization
    - [momentjs](https://momentjs.com/): manage time and dates effectively
    - [express](https://expressjs.com/): server micro framework
    - [masonry](https://masonry.desandro.com/): cascading grid layout library
    - [Threejs](https://threejs.org/): 3d designs
    - [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com): Tailwind CSS Library

### Activity: Experiment with a library

- Pick a 3rd party library from the abovenoted list
- Follow it's introductory tutorial
- Deploy a github repo featuring your work

### End of Day Activity: Recreate Morning Algorithm in JS

- **Focus**: Create objects with methods that are found in your morning activity
- Suggestion: Pick a human or animal in a particular situation and think of the types of things that they are able to do.
- Alternative focus: Use built in object methods to make it easier to work with data in objects
- Programmatically change values in objects nested in arrays (object methods like Object.entries can be really helpful)
