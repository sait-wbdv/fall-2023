### Morning Activity: Algorithms in Everyday Life (15 minutes)

**Focus**: Attributes and actions of a person, place, or thing. (ie: a dog barks and runs; but also has fur color, legs etc.)

1. Create a flowchart of something that you enjoy doing using the instructions linked below (15 minutes)
2. Briefly discuss your findings:
   - What activity did you document? What step(s) did you break down into micro steps?
   - **Walk each other through your steps**
   - When broken into micro steps, did you underestimate how complex the activity actually was?

### End of Day Activity: Recreate Morning Algorithm in JS

**Focus**: Create objects with methods that are found in your morning activity

- Alternative focus: Use built in object methods to make it easier to work with data in objects
