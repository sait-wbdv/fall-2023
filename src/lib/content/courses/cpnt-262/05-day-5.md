<h2>Prep</h2>

- [Read What are Functions in Javascript](<https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-are-functions-in-javascript-a-beginners-guide/#:~:text=A%20function%20is%20a%20block,prompt()%2C%20and%20confirm().>)
- **For Discussion**: Browse the web and find 5 examples of actions that you can do
  - if you can't find examples on websites, try web apps and video games

### Morning Activity: Algorithms in Everyday Life (15 minutes)

**Focus**: Outline small actions part of an activity/task

1. Create a flowchart of something that you enjoy doing using the instructions linked below (15 minutes)
2. Briefly discuss your findings:
   - What activity did you document? What step(s) did you break down into micro steps?
   - **Walk each other through your steps**
   - When broken into micro steps, did you underestimate how complex the activity actually was?

<h2>1. Introduction to Functions</h2>

[![Intro to functions](/images/slides/cpnt-262/js-functions.png)](/slides/cpnt-262/js-functions)

### Key Takeaways

- Functions make code re-usable and portable
- Functions make code safer
- Declare a function to make it invocable, invoke it to use it
- JS has traditional **and** fat-arrow syntax for functions
- Functions can take parameters as arguments
- Functions return values

### Activity: Convert Code into Functions

- Work and discuss in your scrum groups
- Review JS scripts written on days 2 and 3
- Pick 2-3 (everyone does this) and turn them into functions
  - try using arguments for variables
  - pass the values that you used on days 2 and 3 into the function as arguments
  - use a `return` statement to render the output

<h2>2. Build session: DRYing code with functions</h2>

DRY &#8594; Don't Repeat Yourself

- [Starter code](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/dailies-w23/tree/main/2023-02-23-functions/01-tip-calculator-starter)

<h2>3. Learning Feedback</h2>

- Tomorrow will be a concept oriented class that allows us to review syntax and and application
- A poll will be released in Slack to pick a few topics that we can cover in more detail or as a review
  - Students can (and are encouraged to) suggest topics
- Please respond by before you leave today

</LessonPlan>

### End of Day Activity: Recreate Morning Algorithm in JS

- **Focus**: Create [functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions) with traditional or fat arrow syntax that reflect actions in your flow chart.
- Suggestion: Create 1-3 functions that are used inside of a main function
