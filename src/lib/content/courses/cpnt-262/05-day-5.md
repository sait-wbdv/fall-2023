### Morning Activity: Algorithms in Everyday Life (15 minutes)

**Focus**: Outline small actions part of an activity/task

1. Create a flowchart of something that you enjoy doing using the instructions linked below (15 minutes)
2. Briefly discuss your findings:
   - What activity did you document? What step(s) did you break down into micro steps?
   - **Walk each other through your steps**
   - When broken into micro steps, did you underestimate how complex the activity actually was?
