<h2 id="api-routes">Sveltekit API Routes</h2>

- [Overview Video](https://youtu.be/eW8uTGspyV8)
  - Sveltekit features server side routes. These are great for using as API routes
  - This makes it easier to build a full featured app without the need for a separate backend

### In Class Activity: Build API Routes

- In your teams, create new routes with unique names (ie: 1 person does about/ while another does gallery)
- In each of those folders, create `+server.js+ files (1 per folder)
- Use the following syntax to create a server route that will display the text
- make a get request with the following syntax:
- Example:
  ```
  export function GET() {
    return new Response("Hello from the API")
  }
  ```
- Take turns pushing and pulling (or if you have been using branches, merge down)
- Test out each others routes by running a dev server and navigating to the route

<h2 id="post-routes">Activity: Create an API with Post Routes</h2>

- [Follow the code example here](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#server) **Ash will demo and walk through this**
- make an `api/` folder containing `add/`, `subtract/`, `multiply/`, and `divide/`
- with your server routes, create simple equations following the addition example
- Each person try to then use the server side function on your frontend
