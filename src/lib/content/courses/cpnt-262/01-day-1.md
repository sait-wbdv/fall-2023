<h2>Prep</h2>

- Watch [How to begin thinking like a programmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azcrPFhaY9k): A lecture by Andy Harris - we will watch a few sections in class for discussion
- Sign up and check out people's projects on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) - we will use this for our first graded activity
- Advanced Reading: [Javascript Under the Hood](https://medium.com/@idrazhar/0-to-1-series-how-javascript-works-under-the-hood-ffca74f1cc65)
  - how javascript works
  - history of javascript

<h2>CPNT-262 Course High Level Overview</h2>

- **Objectives**:
  - to learn fundamentals about computer programming
  - to be able to build websites using modern technologies
  - **to create a foundation for your future in tech**
- **How to be successful at programming**:
  - focus on problem solving
  - spending enough time practicing to understand concepts
  - collaborate with others
  - avoid comparing yourself to others
  - don't copy/paste code without understanding how it works
- **Scrum Teams**
  - Scrum Standup Sessions will take place at the beginning of open lab
  - You'll have 1 team for days 1-10 and another for 11-20
  - Scrum Standup Sessions shouldn't last more than 15 minutes
  - Answer the following:
    - what I did yesterday
    - what I'm doing today
    - am I blocked by anything

<h2>Flow Charts</h2>

[![Slides - Flowcharts](/images/slides/cpnt-262/js-flowcharts.png)](/slides/cpnt-262/js-flowcharts)

### Activity: Algorithms in Everyday Life (30 minutes)

**Focus**: Anything goes! (within a sharable school context)

1. Create a flowchart of something that you enjoy doing using the instructions linked below (15 minutes)
2. Briefly discuss your findings:
   - What activity did you document? What step(s) did you break down into micro steps?
   - **Walk each other through your steps**
   - When broken into micro steps, did you underestimate how complex the activity actually was?

<h2>Computational Thinking</h2>

### Lecture Slides

### Key Takeaways

- Words, images, numbers... everything that we see on computers are representations of binary values
- Programming logic can be viewed in flowcharts
- **Variables** are "buckets" that hold **values**
- When we think programmatically, we are breaking complex tasks down into small steps and dictating the results at each given step

---

<h2>Pseudo Code</h2>

- Pseudocode is used to think through the steps of an algorithm
  - it exists between the flowcharting and code implementation phases
  - normally pseudocode is written in comments in your actual code
  - when pseudocoding, you move from how a human thinks to how a computer thinks
    - your pseudocode will look like a number of things along this spectrum
- [Geeks for Geeks Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-write-a-pseudo-code/)

### Activity: Flowchart bughunt w/ Pseudocode

- In teams of 2-3 (from scrum groups), review each others' flowcharts
- Identify complexities that haven't been accounted for (ie: assumed decisions, loops, multi-step actions blended together)
- Rewrite your flowchart in pseudocode. **Break things down into small single line statements**
  - Focus on a smaller section of your flowchart if it's starting to get really big

### Show and Tell

- In your scrum groups pick 2 flowchart + pseudocode to walk through (one from each pair)
- 1 person from each subgroup will walk through the flowchart
- The other person will talk through the pseudocode debugging

<h2>Scratch</h2>

<h2>Environment Setup for JS</h2>

- **Working in your scrum teams, make sure that you're able to access node to run .js files**
- Install the [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) extension for VS Code **Linter**
  - helps detect bugs
- Install the [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) extension for VS Code **Formatter**
  - helps detect bad code style
- Install Node:

  - **Easy** - [Binary Installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  - **Maybe Tricky** - [Try nvm](https://www.google.com/search?q=nvm+getting+started) for that pro look.

### End of Day Activity: Recreate Morning activity in Scratch

- This can be later optimized for your 1st graded activity
- When looking at the following gist, remember that Scratch is a programming language too (just a visual one)
