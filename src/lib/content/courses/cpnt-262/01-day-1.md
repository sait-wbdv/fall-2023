<h2>Computational Thinking</h2>

### Activity: Algorithms in Everyday Life (30 minutes)

**Focus**: Anything goes! (within a sharable school context)

1. Create a flowchart of something that you enjoy doing using the instructions linked below (15 minutes)
2. Briefly discuss your findings:
   - What activity did you document? What step(s) did you break down into micro steps?
   - **Walk each other through your steps**
   - When broken into micro steps, did you underestimate how complex the activity actually was?

<h2>Scratch</h2>

<h2>Environment Setup for JS</h2>

- **Working in your scrum teams, make sure that you're able to access node to run .js files**
- Install the [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) extension for VS Code **Linter**
  - helps detect bugs
- Install the [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) extension for VS Code **Formatter**
  - helps detect bad code style
- Install Node:

  - **Easy** - [Binary Installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  - **Maybe Tricky** - [Try nvm](https://www.google.com/search?q=nvm+getting+started) for that pro look.

### End of Day Activity: Recreate Morning activity in Scratch

- This can be later optimized for your 1st graded activity
- When looking at the following gist, remember that Scratch is a programming language too (just a visual one)
