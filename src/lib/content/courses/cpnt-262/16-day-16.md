<h2>Skeleton UI</h2>

- [SkeletonUI](https://www.skeleton.dev/) is a UI component library built on Tailwind
- It ships with prebuild svelte and tailwind components (check the sidebar of their website for the docs)
- These components use **props** to customize and tailor them to your needs
- Use [Design Tokens](https://www.skeleton.dev/docs/tokens) to style content according to a theme

### Setup and Configuration

- [Get started instructions](https://www.skeleton.dev/docs/get-started)
  - SkeletonUI can be added to a project that's already been started
    - **however**, they recommend to start a new project with their template
    - ie: `npm create skeleton-app@latest name-of-app` (don't choose typescript during this course)
  - Tailwind will be installed by default when you use their command (review docs for configuration notes if you don't use their command)
  - Next you add a theme. For 262, use a default one until you're comfortable getting more custom. [docs on theme configuration](https://www.skeleton.dev/docs/themes#dark-mode)
    - a great step for making your own is to use their [theme generator](https://www.skeleton.dev/docs/generator)

### Building with Skeleton Components

1. Create your site layout using [app-shell](https://www.skeleton.dev/components/app-shell), [app-bar](https://www.skeleton.dev/components/app-bar)
   - if you would like a persistent rail on the side (like in vscode), use the [app-rail](https://www.skeleton.dev/components/app-rail)
2. Then add some testing content to a route and make sure everything is working as expected. **document future features that you would like to add based on a look over of the documentation**
3. _Now it's time to have some fun!_ Check out the list of components and pick 2-3 to try out **pay attention to the props, events and usage tabs in the docs**

#### Activity: Plan out a UI

- Use any of your design or 260 assignments as a _"mockup"_
- Audit elements that could be components
  - start with elements that are duplicated or specialized
  - also consider elements that get really code heavy to clean up your routes
- Review the Skeleton docs for prebuilt components that fit your use case
- Make notes on the elements that will need to become custom components

### In Class Demonstration: Add Components to our Sveltekit app

- We will walk through adding some more components and making a small page
  - light mode toggle
  - layout components
  - Accordion

</LessonPlan>

<Achievement {status}>

<h2>Refactor Part of a Website into SkeletonUI+Sveltekit</h2>

- Using the component audit that you did, select 1 aspect of the site to build
- Focus on something that will only involve the skeletonUI components
- Build it and don't overthink it
