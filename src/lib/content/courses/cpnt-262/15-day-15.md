<h2>Concept Refresh</h2>

- Pages vs Components
  - syntax differences
  - use case differences
- Rendering Components
  - file organization and naming
  - import syntax
  - props vs slots
  - style props
- Each Syntax for looping
  - destructuring
  - spread operator

<h2 id="scrum-meeting">Scrum Session</h2>

- what have you been working on?
- what do you plan to be doing?
- do you have any blocks?

<h2 id="logic-in-svelte">Svelte Logic</h2>

- [Official Docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/logic-blocks)
- Svelte has logic built into it's syntax for rendering based on loops and conditionals (among other features)
- **loops** `{#each arr as item}...{/each}` is used for rendering multiple items from an array
  - This is especially useful for lists and arrays of cards or gallery items
  - ie:
  ```
  {#each cardArray as card}
  <Card {...props} />
  {/each}
  ```
- **Conditionals**: `{#if expression}...{/if}` is used for simple if statements
  - this can be extended using conditionals like so:
  ```
  {#if answer === 42}
  <p>Render stuff</p>
  {:else}
  <p>render other stuff</p>
  {/if}
  ```

### In Class Demonstration: Convert the carousel from day 12 into Svelte

- **Step 1**: Migrate vanilla code and set up assets and rendering variations
- Objective: Build a carousel that can be used on any page
- Content: render an array of images with descriptions
- Conditional example: set up 2 elements to feature special content

### Activity: Conditional Rendering in Components

- Make a component that renders different content based on prop values
  - ie: `if name === 'Shaggy'` render a picture of a scooby snack, `else` render the mystery machine
  - you could also use numerical values **arguably easier to start**
  - remember the `{:else}` clause
- Render styles differently based a prop boolean:
  - ie: a feature card might be different from an info card in few enough ways to use the same component but with conditional rendering
    - suggestion: set the InfoCard to be a default in the `{:else}` and have the Feature card include a button and more visual prominance or something
    - for the prop, you can do this with a boolean prop

[![Slides - Svelte Events](/images/slides/svelte-events.png)](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/slides/w23/cpnt-262/svelte-events.html)

### In Class Demonstration: Make the carousel interactive

1. Configure the buttons
2. Check for potential event modifiers that we may want to use
3. Test
4. Deploy

### In Class Activity: Create a darkmode toggle

- Use tailwind css and svelte's event handling to toggle between dark and light mode
- [Tailwind Dark Mode Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode)
- [Svelte Repl Darkmode Example](https://svelte.dev/repl/ed4fef4beceb4b0eb295d1f9fdf3bd62?version=3.6.9)
