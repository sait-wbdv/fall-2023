### Materials

- Javascript.info: [ES Modules: An introduction](https://javascript.info/modules-intro)

**Why bother with modules?**

- Modules can contain private variables, functions, credentials, etc;
- Code can me moved out of our projects to clean up our files;
- Move data to an external that can be shared by multiple pages.

### Key Takeaways

- `data.js` needs to export variables using the `export` keyword:
  ```js
  // /src/lib/data.js
  export const fullName = "Ryan Reynolds";
  ```
  - Any variables without the `export` keyword are private and are not available outside the file.
- The imported data is wrapped in an object, so `+page.svelte` (for example) needs to wrap the imported variable in `{}` (called [destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)).
  ```html
  <!-- /routes/.../+page.svelte -->
  <script>
    import {fullName} from "$lib/data.js";
  </script>
  ```
- In this example, the imported variable name must match the exported variable name.
