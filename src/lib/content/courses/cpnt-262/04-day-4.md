### Morning Activity: Interactivity Treasure Hunt (15 minutes)

- Find 10 examples of interactivity on web pages.
- Things to look for:
  - anything with a button
  - sliders
  - carousels
  - things where the cursor is tracked

<h2>1. Conditionals</h2>

[![Conditional Slides](/images/slides/cpnt-262/js-conditional-code.png)](/slides/cpnt-262/js-conditional-code)

### Key Takeaways

- Conditional statements are based in boolean truthy/falsy options
- an if block doesn't _need_ and else block
  - the else block is generally used when there is an `else if` block
- JS has equality and **strict equality**
- any value can be converted to a boolean value

<h2>2. Javascript and Forms</h2>

[![Javascript Forms Slides](/images/slides/cpnt-262/js-forms.png)](/slides/cpnt-262/js-forms)

### Key Takeaways

- Use the form element if:
  - you're submitting data to a server
  - the controls are triggered by a submit button
- [extra info on button type=submit vs input type=submit](https://html.com/attributes/button-type/#:~:text=Both%20%3Cbutton%20type%3D%22submit,it%20is%20a%20null%20element).
- `event.preventDefault()` is important for when the page shouldn't refresh on submit

### TODO: Activity: log form data

- Create a simple form in codepen and log values to the console on submit

<h2>Scrum Session</h2>

- Reflect on the past week
- Discuss topics that are making sense
- Discuss topics that are confusing
- Discuss strategies to practice the content we're working on

</LessonPlan>

### End of Day Activity: Create a flowchart for one of the things found your treasure hunt

Opposite to how we normally do these, pick one of the interactive website elements that you found and create a flow chart to map it's logic as best as you can.

You can also do this in pseudocode if you prefer

<!--
- **Focus**: Prioritize coding with [conditional logic](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/conditionals). Traditional if/else or ternary operators work depending on context
- Suggestion: map a decision from the morning activity in an if/else block
