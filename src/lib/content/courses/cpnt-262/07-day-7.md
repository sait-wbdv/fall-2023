<h2>Prep</h2>

- Look up javascript string methods
  - try to use 5 of them with sample content in a js file
  - note at least 1 example per method of an application of where it would be useful.
- Try the [Javascript array methods tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/complete-introduction-to-the-most-useful-javascript-array-methods/)

</Homework>

### Morning Activity: Algorithms in Everyday Life (15 minutes)

**Focus**: Activities or tasks that involve things/people being grouped in some way

1. Create a flowchart of something that you enjoy doing using the instructions linked below (15 minutes)
2. Briefly discuss your findings:
   - What activity did you document? What step(s) did you break down into micro steps?
   - **Walk each other through your steps**
   - When broken into micro steps, did you underestimate how complex the activity actually was?

<h2>String Methods</h2>

[![Slides - Javascript strings](/images/slides/cpnt-262/js-strings.png)](/slides/cpnt-262/js-strings)

### Key Takeaways

- JS can convert strings into a String object
  - which includes an array for each character of the string
  - string methods for searching and manipulating strings

### Activity: String method practice

In pairs, practice using string methods:

1. Go to wikipedia and choose a sentence or phrase that interests you (or doesn't);
2. In a new `client.js` file, create a `string` variable containing your selected phrase;
3. Try using the following string methods on your phrase:
   - Using `String.length`, log the sentence "This phrase has Number characters", replacing `[Number]` with the actual number of characters in the `string`.
   - Using `String.startsWith()`, log a `true` or `false` based on whether or not the the word "The" (or similar) matches the start of the `string`.
   - Using `String.endsWith()`, log whether or not the `string` is a question.
   - Using `String.includes()`, log a `true` or `false` based on whether or not the `string` contains the word "the" (or similar).
   - Using `String.indexOf()`, log the `index` of the first matching word (i.e. "the") found in the `string`.
   - Add the `<textarea>` counter back into the starter form.
   - Using `String.split()`, log each character in the `string` as an array.

<h2>Array Methods</h2>

- TODO: Edit slides

[![Slides - Javascript strings](/images/slides/cpnt-262/js-higher-order-array-methods.png)](/slides/cpnt-262/js-higher-order-array-methods)

### Key Takeaways

- JS provides powerful methods for editing array elements
- `.forEach()`, `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()`, `.slice()`, `.sort()`, `.includes()` are all highly specialized
- use array methods when possible for elegant code

### TODO: Activity: Array Method Experiment

- In your scrum groups, divide up some array methods and review their respective documentation
- Come up with 2-3 potential use cases for each (feel free to search online for ideas)
- Code a small POC for 4 of the array methods above
- Demonstrate the POCs to each other
- Class Presentations
  - each team will then show 1 of their examples to the class

</LessonPlan>

### End of Day Activity: Recreate Morning Algorithm in JS

- **Focus**: Use [array methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) or string methods depending on the situation.
- Suggestion: Create two arrays of objects that need to pass values between one another
