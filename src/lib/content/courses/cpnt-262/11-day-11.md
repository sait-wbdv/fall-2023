<h2 id="framework-intro">1. Introduction to JS Frameworks</h2>

- [Video: Quick into to Frameworks](https://youtu.be/VbvMJUpY0a4?si=PPIlssXYkXhoV3gA)
- After learning one, others become easier to also learn
- Reasons why we use them:
  - simplify complex rendering
  - more interactivity
  - easier code management
  - app development
- Important Concepts:
  - Components
  - Client Side vs Server Side
  - Shadow Dom vs Compilation (Currently Svelte is the only one really doing compilation)
  - Code Bundling (done automatically)

### Framework Research and Discussion

1. In your scrum groups, research and answer the following:

- What is a benefit of client side framework?
- What is a drawback of client side frameworks?
- What are some evolutions that frameworks have gone through over time to address some of their issues? (pick a framework that interests you do discuss this)

2. Take your answers and document them in a javascript or JSON file. Use arrays, objects, and variables. **you'll be rendering these later in svelte so make sure the data is organized well**.

3. **Class Debrief**: Pick 1 benefit or drawback and 1 evolution to highlight to the class.

<h2 id="svelte-environment">Svelte Environment Setup</h2>

1. Update [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) to the latest stable release
2. VS Code Extensions: - [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode) - Optional: [Svelte Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ardenivanov.svelte-intellisense) - Optional: [Svelte Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fivethree.vscode-svelte-snippets)
3. Update VS Code preferences: - Set `Workbench Editor: Label Format` to `short` - Optional: - Set `Explorer: Sort order` to `filesFirst` - Uncheck `Explorer: Compact folders`

<h2 id="install-sveltekit">3. Install SvelteKit demo app</h2>

See Docs: [Creating a project](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/creating-a-project)

1.  Navigate to your workspace in the terminal and enter the following command:

    ```bash
    $ npm create svelte@latest hello-demo
    ```

2.  Select the `Demo app` template
    ![Screencap of demo app selection](/images/lessons/sk-demo-app.png)
3.  Select `No` for Typescript
    ![Screencap of js selection](/images/lessons/sk-js.png)
4.  Select no additional options: - Optional: Select ESLint and/or Prettier if you want these.

5.  `cd` into your project:

    ```bash
    $ cd hello-demo

    ```

    ```

    ```

6.  Install dependencies:

        ```bash
        $ npm install

    ```

    ```

7.  Start the dev server to view the demo app

        ```bash
        $ npm run dev

    ```

    ```

<h2 id="project-overview">4. Overview: Project structure</h2>

- Tutorial: [Project structure](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/project-structure)

### Demo: Creating a `data.js` file

- Separate data from the presentation of a file

---

<h2>Deploy to Netlify</h2>

- Create an account with Netlify
- Netlify is a way to deploy forntend sites
- It makes use of serverless functions
- It connects to your git repo
- Use netlify for static deployment
- [Follow the Documentation Guidelines](https://docs.netlify.com/integrations/frameworks/sveltekit/)

<h2 id="scrum-meeting">Scrum Session</h2>

- what have you been working on?
- what do you plan to be doing?
- do you have any blocks?

</LessonPlan>

### Activity: Research how to import data onto a svelte page

- Create a repo with your team, add one another to it and scaffold a sveltekit app
- This can be a throwaway app or you can use it for the in class demonstrations and activities as we learn Svelte
- add a JS or JSON file in the `static/` directory
- use the [official svelte docs](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/welcome-to-svelte) to learn how to import the data onto a page in sveltekit
- try to import a single string from your data file (don't worry about getting deep into the data)
- Submit a link to your repo
- Deploy and submit a link to your netlify site
