<h2>Querying Data</h2>

We are at the point in the course where you'll need to really sharpen your skills at reading docs and code examples to find the info that you're looking for. This skill takes practice.

Especially when searching on code projects, take the time to check that you understand the terms being used, and that you understand what you're looking for. **Take time to do background research queries when you're confused**

### Use these documents to improve your searching

- [Google Power Search Notes](https://gist.github.com/lilyx13/22502670afc429bb8d40d05930373f28)
- [Search Improvement Task Notes](https://gist.github.com/lilyx13/4a2f49d1cdb29cfc624ef22c6ccedafe)

### Activity: Optimize a Search Query

1. Search for something casual that you would normally search for
2. Use search terms to get a more accurate result at the top of the results
3. **Start a new search** for a bug or error that you ran into (preferably one that you didn't get a clear answer on)
4. Use our search techniques to find more helpful information
5. Discuss what worked in your groups

<h2 id="framework-intro">1. Introduction to JS Frameworks</h2>

- [Video: Quick into to Frameworks](https://youtu.be/VbvMJUpY0a4?si=PPIlssXYkXhoV3gA)
- After learning one, others become easier to also learn
- Reasons why we use them:
  - simplify complex rendering
  - more interactivity
  - easier code management
  - app development
- Important Concepts:
  - Components
  - Client Side vs Server Side
  - Shadow Dom vs Compilation (Currently Svelte is the only one really doing compilation)
  - Code Bundling (done automatically)

### Framework Research and Discussion

1. In your scrum groups, research and answer the following:

- What is a benefit of client side framework?
- What is a drawback of client side frameworks?
- What are some evolutions that frameworks have gone through over time to address some of their issues? (pick a framework that interests you do discuss this)

2. Take your answers and document them in a javascript or JSON file. Use arrays, objects, and variables. **you'll be rendering these later in svelte so make sure the data is organized well**.

3. **Class Debrief**: Pick 1 benefit or drawback and 1 evolution to highlight to the class.

<h2 id="svelte-environment">Svelte Environment Setup</h2>

1. Update [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) to the latest stable release
2. VS Code Extensions: - [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode) - Optional: [Svelte Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ardenivanov.svelte-intellisense) - Optional: [Svelte Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fivethree.vscode-svelte-snippets)
3. Update VS Code preferences: - Set `Workbench Editor: Label Format` to `short` - Optional: - Set `Explorer: Sort order` to `filesFirst` - Uncheck `Explorer: Compact folders`

See: [10X Your SvelteKit Developer Experience in VSCode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13v50nLh67Q) for more tips

<h2 id="install-sveltekit">3. Install SvelteKit demo app</h2>

See Docs: [Creating a project](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/creating-a-project)

1.  Navigate to your workspace in the terminal and enter the following command:

    ```bash
    $ npm create svelte@latest hello-demo
    ```

2.  Select the `Demo app` template
    ![Screencap of demo app selection](/images/lessons/sk-demo-app.png)
3.  Select `No` for Typescript
    ![Screencap of js selection](/images/lessons/sk-js.png)
4.  Select no additional options: - Optional: Select ESLint and/or Prettier if you want these.

5.  `cd` into your project:

    ```bash
    $ cd hello-demo

    ```

    ```

    ```

6.  Install dependencies:

        ```bash
        $ npm install

    ```

    ```

7.  Start the dev server to view the demo app

        ```bash
        $ npm run dev

    ```

    ```

<h2 id="project-overview">4. Overview: Project structure</h2>

- ## Overview: [Project structure](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/project-structure)

### Demo: Creating a `data.js` file

- Separate data from the presentation of a file

---

<h2>Deploy to Netlify</h2>

- Create an account with Netlify
- Netlify is a way to deploy forntend sites
- It makes use of serverless functions
- It connects to your git repo
- Use netlify for static deployment
- [Follow the Documentation Guidelines](https://docs.netlify.com/integrations/frameworks/sveltekit/)

- what have you been working on?
- what do you plan to be doing?
- do you have any blocks?

</LessonPlan>

<Achievement {status}>

### Basic Activity: Add some pages to a skeleton svelte app

- Install another svelte app, one that you can use for practice throughout the next 10 days
- Add 3 new folders in routes with `+page.svelte` files in them
- Add some html to the files (minimal)
- Run you server and make sure teh content shows up
- Then push your code to github

### Advanced Activity: Research how to import data onto a svelte page

- Create a repo with your team, add one another to it and scaffold a sveltekit app
- This can be a throwaway app or you can use it for the in class demonstrations and activities as we learn Svelte
- add a JS or JSON file in the `static/` directory
- use the [official svelte docs](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/welcome-to-svelte) to learn how to import the data onto a page in sveltekit
- try to import a single string from your data file (don't worry about getting deep into the data)
- Submit a link to your repo
- Deploy and submit a link to your netlify site
