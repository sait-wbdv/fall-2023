<h2>Graded Activity 6: Reactivity and Events</h2>

- [Link to assignment](/courses/cpnt-262/assessments/activity-6)
- Due: November 13 @ 11:59PM
- The last graded activity for 262!
- **Focus**: Create events in svelte

---

<h2>The Fox, Goose, and Corn Problem</h2>
- A farmer needs to get a fox, goose, and bag of corn across a river
- the farmer can only move 1 at a time

### Conditions

- The fox cannot be alone with the goose
- The goose cannot be alone with the corn

### How to solve?

<h2 id="scrum-meeting">Scrum Session</h2>

- what have you been working on?
- what do you plan to be doing?
- do you have any blocks?
- **discuss errors** what is your method to solve them? walk through your processes

<h2>Morning WarmUp: Sveltekit Tutorial Review</h2>

- We will walk through parts of: [Basic Sveltekit](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/introducing-sveltekit)
  - Routing: Route parameters
  - Loading Data: Page Data
  - Svelte Lifecycle
- Video: [What are Lifecycle Hooks?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ITICCcNxOE)

---

<h2>Error Handling</h2>

- Using `try/catch` blocks
  - [mdn docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch)
  - These are used to **"try"** to run code, but if it fails, **"catch"** it
  - [`console.error()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/error) is better for error handling than `console.log()`
  - [difference between console.error() and console.log()](https://linuxhint.com/what-is-the-difference-between-consoleerror-and-consolelog-methods/)
- Review [Error handling and Redirects in sveltes tutorial](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/error-basics)
  - throw Error syntax
  - Error Pages
  - Redirects

### Demonstration: Error handling to the animal problem

<h2>Stores</h2>

All frontend frameworks have a way of handling state, these are usually referred to as stores

- In Svelte, stores are built into the frameowrk
- For Vue or React, you'd use Pinia or Redux (respectively)

### Component State vs Global State vs localStorage

- localStorage can be used to save information in a client's browser. Like session storage, this can be useful for seamless UX, however it can open up security issues... and conflates your app's storage with the client's storage
- **Stores are great for data that is manipulated by many pages and/or components**
- [Svelte Store Docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte-store)

### Types of Stores

- writable: data can be modified by "subscribers" (components)
  - use for data that components should change
- readable: data can only be read by "subscribers"
  - use for data that should only be read

#### Example 1: Global Readable Data

- Set up a store with reusable data
- Render the data on multiple routes and components

#### Example 2: Multi Component Counter

- Goal: Break a counter up into multiple components
- render the value on a second page to demonstrate how it can be updated

#### Activity: Built a counter and prep for a "like" tracker

- Finish recreating the counter used
- Plan out how you might use similar logic to track social media likes for a post, image, or other type of media

<h2>Add Error Handling to code</h2>

- Take some code that you've worked on, and try adding error handling to it
  - try/catch for logic blocks
  - console.error()
  - a redirect
  - throw error syntax
- It can be helpful to make something that's intentionally broken and use try/catch + console.error to experiment
