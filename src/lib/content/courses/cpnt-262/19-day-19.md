<h2 id="scrum-meeting">Scrum Session</h2>

- what have you been working on?
- what do you plan to be doing?
- do you have any blocks?
- **discussion topic**: What data did you fetch or create? what was a key takeaway from that experience for you?

<h2>Assignment 3: Multi Page Website (Pair Project)</h2>

- [Link to Assignment](/courses/cpnt-262/assessments/assignment-3)
- Create a full featured multipage website.
- Your site will have a gallery and use a third party api of your choice

<h2 id="api-routes">3. Sveltekit API Routes</h2>

[Slides - Introduction to Routing](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/slides/w23/cpnt-262/http-rest.html)

- [Overview Video](https://youtu.be/eW8uTGspyV8)
  - Sveltekit features server side routes. These are great for using as API routes
  - This makes it easier to build a full featured app without the need for a separate backend

### Demonstrations

1. load page data in a `+page.js` file and log it
2. Create a fetch call on an api route and log it

### +server.js vs +page.js vs +page.server.js

- +server.js files should be in an `api/` directory
  - these are for API routes and use GET and POST requests
- +page.js files should be with their respective +page.svelte files
  - these are used to load page data
  - **do not put api keys in these files**
- +page.server.js
  - only runs on the server
  - use for content that the client should never see **like api keys**

### In Class Activity: Build API Routes

- In your teams, create new routes with unique names (ie: 1 person does about/ while another does gallery)
- In each of those folders, create `+server.js+ files (1 per folder)
- Use the following syntax to create a server route that will display the text
- make a get request with the following syntax:
- Example:
  ```
  export function GET() {
    return new Response("Hello from the API")
  }
  ```
- Take turns pushing and pulling (or if you have been using branches, merge down)
- Test out each others routes by running a dev server and navigating to the route

<h2>Render data in a +page.svelte</h2>

- [Recieving Data from an api route](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#server-receiving-data)
- Just like a separately hosted API, the data needs to be called into the route for use
- use a fetch call to your api, this will allow you to make a
- Data is passed using json, so you'll need to use [json.stringify](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) to handle data

#### Activity: Render the data from your server routes onto a +page.svelte

- 

<h2 id="route-params"> 2. Route parameters</h2>

- Route parameters and dynamic routes all you to create things like blogs and product pages really easily

**Routing Tutorial**

- Review: [Pages](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/pages)
- Review: [Layouts](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/layouts)
- [Route parameters](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/params)

Slides: [Dynamic Routes](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/slides/w23/cpnt-262/sveltekit-introduction.html#/13)

### Key Takeaways

- Route params are variables we import from the URL with `[]`;

  ```
  /players/[id]/+page.svelte
  ```

      - This creates an `id` variable that stores the URL segment as it's value

#### Activity: Make a dynamic route

- Create a dynamic route as per the docs
- Match it to render markdown files in a content directory
- Render a few lines of text in markdown
- Verify that the new routes are created

<h2>Node Express (a very abbreviated intro)</h2>

- Express puts the E in **MERN**, **MEVN**, and **MEAN** stacks (react, vue, and angular respectively)
- It is a server micro library
- Modern frameworks like Sveltekit, NextJS, and NuxtJS support server side routes
- However you may work on projects that have a separate backend (or you might just really like backend development)
- A standalone backend will give you more control over ports and how everything works, but it's much more challenging to configure and get working

### Hello Express Tutorial

- This will show you the basics of creating a server with endpoints. You would use this to create a standalone backend
