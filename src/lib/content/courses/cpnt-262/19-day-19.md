<h2 id="route-params"> 2. Route parameters</h2>

**Routing Tutorial**

- Review: [Pages](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/pages)
- Review: [Layouts](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/layouts)
- [Route parameters](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/params)

Slides: [Dynamic Routes](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/slides/w23/cpnt-262/sveltekit-introduction.html#/13)

### Key Takeaways

- Route params are variables we import from the URL with `[]`;

  ```
  /players/[id]/+page.svelte
  ```

      - This creates an `id` variable that stores the URL segment as it's value

  ```

  ```

- Params can be accessed from the special SvelteKit `$page` object; - Because this is a Svelte store, you must use the `$` when accessing it.
- We use params to look up an items data in a database (in our case, an array of objects)

### Demo: Displaying RPG Players

- [`player` route](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/w23-refactor-example/tree/main/src/routes/dailies/2023-03-22-route-params/players) - [Live Demo](https://w23-sveltekit-examples.vercel.app/dailies/2023-03-22-route-params/players)
- [Example `fruit` and `color` routes](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/w23-refactor-example/tree/main/src/routes/dailies/2023-03-22-route-params/route-param-example)
  - [Live Demo](https://w23-sveltekit-examples.vercel.app/dailies/2023-03-22-route-params/route-param-example)

**Goals**

- Add an item route to `players` with route parameters:

  ```
  GET /players/:id
  ```

<h2>Node Express (a very abbreviated intro)</h2>

- Express puts the E in **MERN**, **MEVN**, and **MEAN** stacks (react, vue, and angular respectively)
- It is a server micro library
- Modern frameworks like Sveltekit, NextJS, and NuxtJS support server side routes
- However you may work on projects that have a separate backend (or you might just really like backend development)
- A standalone backend will give you more control over ports and how everything works, but it's much more challenging to configure and get working

### Hello Express Tutorial

- This will show you the basics of creating a server with endpoints. You would use this to create a standalone backend
