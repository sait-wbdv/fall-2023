<h2 id="scrum-meeting">Scrum Session</h2>

- what have you been working on?
- what do you plan to be doing?
- do you have any blocks?
- **discussion topic**: What data did you fetch or create? what was a key takeaway from that experience for you?

<h2>Assignment 3: Multi Page Website (Pair Project)</h2>

- [Link to Assignment](/courses/cpnt-262/assessments/assignment-3)
- Create a full featured multipage website.
- Your site will have a gallery and use a third party api of your choice

<h2 id="es-modules"> ES modules</h2>

### Materials

- Javascript.info: [ES Modules: An introduction](https://javascript.info/modules-intro)

**Why bother with modules?**

- Modules can contain private variables, functions, credentials, etc;
- Code can me moved out of our projects to clean up our files;
- Move data to an external that can be shared by multiple pages.

### Key Takeaways

- `data.js` needs to export variables using the `export` keyword:
  ```js
  // /src/lib/data.js
  export const fullName = "Ryan Reynolds";
  ```
  - Any variables without the `export` keyword are private and are not available outside the file.
- The imported data is wrapped in an object, so `+page.svelte` (for example) needs to wrap the imported variable in `{}` (called [destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)).
  ```html
  <!-- /routes/.../+page.svelte -->
  <script>
    import {fullName} from "$lib/data.js";
  </script>
  ```
- In this example, the imported variable name must match the exported variable name.

### Activity: Separate page data from one of our in class examples to a separate file

- Create a data file
- Organize the values from a page into objects and arrays
- export the data
- import it to the page
- change the static text to be that from the data import

<h2 id="route-params"> 2. Route parameters</h2>

- Route parameters and dynamic routes all you to create things like blogs and product pages really easily

**Routing Tutorial**

- Review: [Pages](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/pages)
- Review: [Layouts](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/layouts)
- [Route parameters](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/params)

Slides: [Dynamic Routes](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/slides/w23/cpnt-262/sveltekit-introduction.html#/13)

### Key Takeaways

- Route params are variables we import from the URL with `[]`;

  ```
  /players/[id]/+page.svelte
  ```

      - This creates an `id` variable that stores the URL segment as it's value

  ```

  ```

#### Activity: Make a dynamic route

- Create a dynamic route as per the docs
- Match it to render markdown files in a content directory
- Render a few lines of text in markdown
- Verify that the new routes are created

<h2>Node Express (a very abbreviated intro)</h2>

- Express puts the E in **MERN**, **MEVN**, and **MEAN** stacks (react, vue, and angular respectively)
- It is a server micro library
- Modern frameworks like Sveltekit, NextJS, and NuxtJS support server side routes
- However you may work on projects that have a separate backend (or you might just really like backend development)
- A standalone backend will give you more control over ports and how everything works, but it's much more challenging to configure and get working

### Hello Express Tutorial

- This will show you the basics of creating a server with endpoints. You would use this to create a standalone backend
