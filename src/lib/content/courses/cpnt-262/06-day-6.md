### Morning Activity: Algorithms in Everyday Life (15 minutes)

**Focus**: Anything goes! (within a sharable school context)

1. Create a flowchart of something that you enjoy doing using the instructions linked below (15 minutes)
2. Briefly discuss your findings:
   - What activity did you document? What step(s) did you break down into micro steps?
   - **Walk each other through your steps**
   - When broken into micro steps, did you underestimate how complex the activity actually was?

### End of Day Activity: Recreate Morning Algorithm in JS

- **Focus**: Anything goes! (I recommend: focusing on a topic that has been confusing)
- Suggestion: try to make 20 minimal algorithms! small and simple is better.
