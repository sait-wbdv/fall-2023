### Morning Activity: Algorithms in Everyday Life (15 minutes)

**Focus**: Anything goes! (within a sharable school context)

1. Create a flowchart of something that you enjoy doing using the instructions linked below (15 minutes)
2. Briefly discuss your findings:
   - What activity did you document? What step(s) did you break down into micro steps?
   - **Walk each other through your steps**
   - When broken into micro steps, did you underestimate how complex the activity actually was?

<h2> 1. Statements vs Expressions</h2>

[![Slides - Statements vs Expressions](/images/slides/cpnt-262/js-expressions-vs-statements.png)](/slides/cpnt-262/js-expressions-vs-statements)

### Key Takeaways

- statements contain expressions
- if a chunk of js returns undefined, it's a statement (otherwise it's an expression)
- all the operators we've covered are functions that return values --> **expressions**

### Treasure Hunt: Expressions

In your scrum groups:

1. Find two or three examples of Javascript statements online;
2. How many expressions can you find in each statement?
   - Hint:
     1. Count the literal values;
     2. Count the variables;
     3. Count the operators;
     4. Add them all together.
3. If each expression was converted to a Boolean value, what would it be?

You will be presenting your findings to the rest of the class.

<h2>Value Validation</h2>

<h2>Syntax and Concept Review</h2>

Based on feedback from our poll

### Topics

---

<h2>3. Pair Coding: Return Expression to HTML</h2>
_Take turns in a driver/navigator format_

1. Use the statements that you discovered in the Treasure Hunt
2. Come up with implementations of them in a repo that you all have access to
   - this is a good time to practice adding one another to a repo and collaborating
3. Render the output onto html pages

### End of Day Activity: Recreate Morning Algorithm in JS

- **Focus**: Anything goes! (I recommend: focusing on a topic that has been confusing)
- Suggestion: try to make 20 minimal algorithms! small and simple is better.
