### Morning Activity: Plan out a beverage app

- Outline the following for how you make your morning beverage
  - objective: what is the primary action that is being accomplished (all others are a part of this)
  - variables: the items involved and their properties
  - functions: what actions can be done? are they part of variable properties or things that you do?

<h2> 1. Statements vs Expressions</h2>

### Key Takeaways

- statements contain expressions
- if a chunk of js returns undefined, it's a statement (otherwise it's an expression)
- all the operators we've covered are functions that return values --> **expressions**

### Morning Beverage Statements

- in programmatic terms but still pseudocode, write down statements that you might use to code your beverages
- ie: assign and set up variables and named functions
- work in js if you're able to visualize it, if not focus on objectives and outcomes

#### Debrief

- Discuss a statement that you had difficulty composing
- Give one another feedback

<h2>Syntax and Concept Review</h2>

Based on feedback from our poll

### Topics

- string, array, object, or Math methods
- Manipulating things with functions
- Variables and displaying them on an html page

### Demonstrations

- [Responsive Navigation](https://codepen.io/lilyx/pen/zYyeLaP)
  - follow up with things we've started
  - demo using matchMedia and classList
- Create a food app
  - explore using predefined methods
  - create functions
  - add methods to objects
  - testing output

### End of Day Activity: Code your Morning Beverage

- Similar to the in class demonstrations, try to create some logic that would be used to automate a morning beverage making process
- functions for:
  - pouring
  - heating
  - steeping
- variables for:
  - water/water source
  - method of heating
  - source of tea/coffee/...
  - addons?
