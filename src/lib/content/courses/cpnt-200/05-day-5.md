<h2>Intro to Content Management</h2>

- We've been using locally hosted files in our websites for data. However this is not sustainable for many projects
  - issues:
    - you need to be a coder to be able to edit page data
    - page data isn't stored in a structured environment and requires editing template files to change things
    - Data in data.js type files requires going in and editing them
  - solutions:
    - host data in a database (as we've started to learn how to do)
    - set up a CMS that provides a user friendly way to edit, update, and access data
      - ie: Wordpress
- A CMS (content management system) is a way to solve these issues
- Popular CMS' include: Wordpress, Drupal, Strapi, Sanity...
- Traditionally CMS' like Wordpress bundles the actual data with the presentation through a theme

### Headless vs Monolithic CMS Architecture

- Video: [What's the point of a headless CMS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Uor3I0n_vQ)
- Traditional cms' are heavy and susceptible to attack, their plugin systems offer a lot of customizability but also introduce vulnerabilities, bloat, and pay walls
- Headless CMS', while taking more initial setup time offer:
  - lighter deployment
  - separation of data from presentation
  - added security
  - better developer experience
  - cheaper to run
  - more customizability
- However the drawbacks are:
  - the project will need a developer (this is good for us, and actually good for client even if they don't see it)
  - more setup time is required
  - more decisions need to be made at the beginning
  - initial setup time can be longer

<h2>Our Stack: Supabase + Directus</h2>

- **[Supabase](https://supabase.com/): Database**
- **[Directus](https://directus.io/): Content Management Interface**
- [Sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev): Frontend
- [Nelify](https://netlify.com): Deployment
- [Github](https://github.com): Code Storage

### What does Directus do? and how are we using it

- Directus is an open source headless CMS
- Allows you rto build an interface for adding, deleting, modifying information in the database
- While it has it's own hosting, that costs money, so we are using it as an NPM project just like our website. **we configure it to connect to supabase**
  - benefits of this: it gives you the power and freedom of supabase, with the user friendly (especially for non devs) content editing experience

### Demo: Set up and configure Directus+Supabase

- [Tutorial](https://supabase.com/partners/integrations/directus)

### Activity: Connect directus to Supabase

- using the deployed supabase project from last class
- set up directus as per the tutorial instructions
- run directus locally
