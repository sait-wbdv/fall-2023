<h2>Course Overview</h2>

This course is all about data. How it's stored, types of storage, how we access it, and how we manage it.

### Topics and Technologies

- SQL Databases (primary data structure focus) **database type**
  - sqlite
  - postgresql
- NOSQL **database type**
  - document driven
  - JSON
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) **API Tool**
- Content Management Systems **Data Management Tool**
  - [Directus](https://docs.directus.io/)
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) **Firebase Alternative**
  - Backend as a Service

<h2>Metaphors for Data</h2>

**google docs lists == nosql and google sheets == sql**

### Activity: Planning Data Structures 15 Minutes

**Objective**: Compare the two main ways that data is organized using common office tools.

1. Create a table in google sheets
   - Select pick a topic to make a table about (suggestions below)
   - library
   - users
   - game scores (sports or other)
2. create a document in google docs
   - Organize text content from a webpage into the document
   - Use google docs' headings to organize the content into sections
   - Use lists and sub headings to group as close to the actual website structure
3. recreate 1 level 2 heading worth of content from your doc file into a json file
   - ie the header for a page:
   ```json
   {
     "pageTitle": "Page Title",
     "pageDescription": "blah blah blah",
     "image": {"src": "/path/file.jpg", "alt": "description of image"},
     "callToAction": [{"href": "https://url", "text": "Click me"}]
   }
   ```
4. Note 3 benefits and 3 potential problems of each way of organizing data

### Local Filetypes for Data

- csv (Comma Separated Values): A table filetype that is plain text and uses commas to organized columns and rows.
  - Can be used in javascript
  - emulates the kind of structure used in sql tables
  - [Svelte example](https://svelte.dev/repl/d41603e8668945dba79459575590261e?version=3.47.0)
  - _generally you won't have to import csvs into something like svelte, but you will import them into databases_
- json (Javascript Object Notation): A document key-value pair type of data structure.
  - This is the way that data is organized and passed from APIs
  - this document driven appraoch is how NOSQL databases like Mongo DB organize data

<h2>Introduction to Postman</h2>

- Install: [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) - A browser for working with APIs
- [Postman Documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/introduction/overview/)
- [List of Public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
- [REST APIs: Practice endpoints](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/673dfc5c11ce06e9e8cd6ce33609eb3c)

### Notes

- Postman is used for testing API endpoints
- Use it to fetch data and verify it's structure
- Develop queries that can be used in your applications

<h2>Lab Activity</h2>

- Query Data from a public api of your choosing
  - find a public api that is interesting to you and easy(ish) to use
- Use Postman to query the data
  - query data 5 times, try to get more specific with each query
- Document your process and the queries that you used.
