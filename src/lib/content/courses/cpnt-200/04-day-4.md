<h2>Getting Started with Supabase</h2>

<!-- TODO: migrate slides and set up images  -->

[![Slides - Supabase with Sveltekit](/images/slides/supabase-sveltekit.png)](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/slides/w23/cpnt-200/supabase-introduction.html)

### Demo: Tutorial Walkthrough

_Tasks Overview_

1. Create a project in Supabase
2. Add data to a database
3. Set up sveltekit on your computer
4. Import supabase library
5. Set up API Keys
6. configure `$lib/supabaseClient.js`
7. Handle data imports with `+page.server.js` and `+page.svelte` files
8. Render the data with an `{#each}` loop

### Activity: Add a unique db to supabase 20 minutes

- GOAL: Create a minimal custom database

1. copy data table from google sheets into supabase - Use the docs [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/tables) for support
2. using the steps from the demo, import the data into sveltekit
3. console.log() your data
4. pass the data to a frontend page and render something from it

<h2>Deplyment to Netlify</h2>

### Environment Variables

- These are how you set up your api keys on netlify or any other serverless hosting platform. Services like Mongo Atlas, Wordpress, AWS and others will have similar approaches (but with potentially different features and tasks)
- Just like how we use a `.env` file for API keys, in netlify when you're setting up a project, you add environment variables to your netlify deployment
- **note** Frameworks have variations on the syntax used to import and access keys from .env files, refer to documentation when needed

#### Activity: Deploy your demo site to netlify

1. Make sure your repo is up to date and pushed
2. In netlify create a new project and connect it to your repo
3. when setting it up, add the environment variable key values that you have in your .env file
4. run deploy

**NOTE**: you can add environment variables or change them after the fact
