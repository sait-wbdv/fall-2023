<h2>2. Cloning our first (read-only) repo</h2>

### Instructions
1. Create a `read-only` directory in your workspace;
2. Navigate to this directory in your terminal;
		- Pro-tip: You can open the embedded terminal in VS Code!
3. Open the **[Clone Happy](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/1a6e3324d97e61fa0ee59bc4cba3ef33)** activity and clone some code!

### Materials
- [Clone Happy Activity](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/1a6e3324d97e61fa0ee59bc4cba3ef33)

<h2>3. First-time Git Config Setup</h2>

Cloning 3rd party repos is great, but we'd like to create our own repos eventually (i.e. today!). But first, we need to set our name and email in Git.

### Materials
- **[Git - First-time setup](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/6ca4c62d88570732d3760904ef965e4d)**

<h2>4. Publishing our First Website</h2>

Now that we've set up Git, let's actually use it!

### Materials
- **[Project: Publish a webpage with Git and GitHub Pages](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/5d45f96bc11fada75038e552f9ba1a5c)**
- Optional(?): [Set up SSH Keys](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/dd9ae11a238e9f14ad0b066298f35dc5) if you're having trouble pushing code to GitHub.
