### Making changes in a Branch

1. Create an empty `index.html` page in a new Git repo in your workspace and publish to GitHub.
2. In this project, create a new branch called `201-ach-5`.
	```
	$ git checkout -b 201-ach-5
	```
3. Add TailwindCSS to `index.html` by adding the following line to the `<head>` of the document:
	```html
	<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
	```
4. Add and commit changes to this branch.
5. Try changing the background color using TailwindCSS:
	```html
	<body class="bg-amber-600">
	```
6. Add and commit changes to this branch.
7. Push this branch to GitHub.
	```
	$ git push --set-upstream origin 201-ach-5
	```
	- Pro-tip: Git will give you the above code if you try to `git push`. Copy and paste this code as a new command.
8. Checkout your `main` branch.
	```
	$ git checkout main
	```
9. Merge the `201-ach-5` branch into the main branch:
	```
	$ git merge 201-ach-5
	```
	- Note: you always have to checkout the branch you're merging changes _into_.
10. Push these new changes to `main` branch on GitHub.
		
	```
	$ git push
	```

### Submission Instructions
Publish the `main` branch to GH Pages and submit the following to Brightspace:
- GH repo
- GH Pages link
- A link to the `201-ach-5` branch that you pushed
	- You can select the branch in a drop-down menu on your repo home page.
