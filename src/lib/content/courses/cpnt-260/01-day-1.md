### Pair Coding!

**Materials**
- [Pair programming process with Fiona and Semira](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/caa20b2520814a94240043c40301024a)

**Instructions**

Download or clone [Hello Vanilla] into your workspace.
1. Identify asset files in the root directory that should be in dedicated folders:
    - CSS files should be in a `css` directory;
    - Javascript files should be in a `js` directory;
    - Images (`jpg`, `png`, `svg`, etc) should be in an `images` directory.
2. For each of the files you identified, create a dedicated directory in the project root.
3. Move each identified file into the appropriate directory.
4. Ensure the names of all files and directories conform to accepted naming conventions.
5. Fix any links to these files that may have broken when you moved the files. The project should operate just as it did before you moved the files.

### Videos
- [HTML & CSS Full Course for free (2023)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGTJBPNC-Gw)
	- You don't have to watch the whole video (4 hrs long). Feel free to skip around to get the basics.

### Mozilla Developer Network
This is the official textbook for this course (as well as CPNT 262). These two Guides will get you started with HTML and CSS but you are encourage to check out more of their content as needed:
- [Getting started with HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started)
- [What is CSS?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/What_is_CSS)
- [Getting started with CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/Getting_started)

### Optional: Free Online Courses 
There are a lot of courses available online but these are recommended for beginners:
- [Mimo](https://mimo.org)
	- This site has many courses for different languages but their Web Development stream comes highly recommended by past students.
- [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/)
	- This is probably one of the most well known online course.
