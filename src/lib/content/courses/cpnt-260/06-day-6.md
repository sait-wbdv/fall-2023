<h2>1. Splitting Styles and Review</h2>

### Example Code
- [Mobile-first Example](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/dailies-f23/tree/main/2023-09-25-media-flex/02-mobile-first-example)

### Activity: CSS Separation
1. Take one of your projects with the most CSS.
2. Split your stylesheet logically into multiple files, such as:
		- `reset.css`
		- `typography.css`
		- `layout.css`
		- etc
3. `<link>` to each of these files in your `index.html`.

### `min-width` Media Query
Add a mobile-first media query to a project.

#### Instructions
1. Take an example of your own code from previous lessons in this course.
		- You may use [this sample code](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/dailies-f23/tree/main/2023-09-25-media-flex/03-nested-flex-banner) for partial marks.
2. Choose some styles within your project that you would like to show only on Desktop screens. For example, on Desktop:
		- Show or hide an element;
		- Make the font-size larger;
		- Add a flexbox;
3. Create a `min-width` media query at the end of your stylesheet and move your selected styles into it.
4. View your site on both mobile and desktop screen widths (you can do this in the Inspector).
		- Does the design make sense to the user?

#### Marking Criteria
Full points will be awarded for media queries that:
- are practical;
- extend the examples given in class;
- show originality.
