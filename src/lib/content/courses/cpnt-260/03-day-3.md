### Materials
- [Images in HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Images_in_HTML)
- [Starter Code](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/dailies-f23/tree/main/2023-09-13-images-colour/01-wiki-starter)

### Tools
- [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/)

### Instructions
#### Responsive Image
1. Copy and paste the [starter code](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/dailies-f23/tree/main/2023-09-13-images-colour/01-wiki-starter) into your workspace or use your own code from yesterday.
2. Add an `<img>` element to the top of the page inside the `<section>` element:
	- Set `src` to a [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/) images such as:
		- `https://picsum.photos/id/237/200/300`
		- Experiment with the last two numbers in the URL to set different a height and width of the image.
	- Set `alt` text to something that describes your image;
3. In your CSS, target your new image with a [type selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Type_selectors):
	- Set `display` to `block`
	- Set `width` to `100%` (this makes your image responsive)

#### Floated Circular Image
1. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 above, placing the image before an `<h2>` element;
2. In your CSS, target your second image using a [class selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors) and:
	- Set `float` property to `left` or `right` (try both and see what happens)
	- Set `border-radius` to `50%` or some other length value.
