<h2>Activity: 2-up, 4-up</h2>

### Materials
- [Starter Code] (coming soon)
- [`nth-child`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child)
    - useful for alternating colours in a design

In groups of 2 or 3, build 3 grid layouts:
1. Make a split-hero section: fill the page with two items with different background colours, side-by-side.
2. Refactor your code to be a 2x2 grid.
