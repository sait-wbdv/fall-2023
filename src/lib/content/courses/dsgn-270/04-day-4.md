### Each person takes a turn to answer the following questions:

1.  What did you do yesterday?
2.  What will you do today?
3.  Anything blocking your progress?

<h2>Boolean Operations</h2>

These are used to manipulate paths with one another. They are essential for creating high quality designs.

### Most useful Booleans

- Union: They will become 1 shape
- Subtract: The top shape cuts off from the bottom shape

**Union is different from grouping. Grouping doesn't actually change any elements**

<h2>SVG Optimization</h2>

### Instructor Led Activity: Update the Android logo Using Booleans

- Let's Look at our android logo and use subtract and union to reduce the paths
- Use [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) to optimize and prepare the svg for use in code
  - **remove height and width** when you need it to be responsive
  - **Prefer viewbox**
  - **Prettify output**

<h2>Style SVGs with CSS</h2>

### Key Takeaways

- You have 3 options to load svgs onto a web page
- Pick the option that makes sense for the use case
- Inline SVGs can be edited with css and js

<h2>Expectations of working with SVGs</h2>

As a developer, you might not have to work with svgs too much. However when you do, you'll want to nail these points:

- Always clean up your design files by labelling, grouping, removing unnecessary paths, and running booleans when necessary
- Always optimize your svgs so that the files are small and so they can be used inline without headaches
- Be aware of the size of your frame
  - SVGs are scalable, but big designs create big files
- Consider how your logo will look monochrome (1 color & transparent)
