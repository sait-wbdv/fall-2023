<h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>

- Definition: The design principle of arranging elements to show their order of importance. Visual hierarchy controls how the user experiences the content on a web page.
- Activity: Fix visual hierarchy in a disaster of a google doc
- Video: [The Freelancer's Journey](https://youtu.be/qZWDJqY27bw?si=rdCiKsAx7sken-QH)
- Key takeaways to create good visual hierarchy
	- Determine the most imporant elements
	- Establish hierarchy with **position**, **size**, and **color**

### Building Blocks of Visual Hierarchy
- Size
- Color
- Contrast
- Alignment
- Repetition
- Proximity
- Whitespace
- Texture and Style


<h2>Usability</h2>
	- Definition: A **quality attribute** that assesses how easy a user interface is to use. Defined by 5 quality components: **learnability**, **efficiency**, **memorability**, **errors**, **satisfaction**
		- [source](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/#:~:text=Usability%20is%20a%20quality%20attribute,use%20during%20the%20design%20process.)
	- What do we do with this information:
		- Prioritize creating usable websites and apps by reviewing how learnable, efficient, memorable, helpful, and satisfying a site is to use
- Activity: 
- Key Takeaways for usability:
	- design for the client's client to make apps and site's easy to use from their povs. create support and avenues for learnability

<h2>Accessibility</h2>
- Definition: Web accessibility, or eAccessibility, is the inclusive practice of ensuring there are no barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to, websites on the World Wide Web by people with physical disabilities, situational disabilities, and socio-economic restrictions on bandwidth and speed.[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_accessibility)
