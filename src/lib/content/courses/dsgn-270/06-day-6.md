title: Component Crafting in Figma
excerpt: We will learn how to make reusable components in Figma. Focusing on medium to high fidelity design, this class covers techniques used to design UI elements that can be replicated across a broader design.

<h2>Prep Materials</h2>

- [A Guide to Components in Figma](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038662654-Guide-to-components-in-Figma)

<h2 id="standup">Daily Standup</h2>

- In each block of dsgn-270, you'll have a group of 3-4 with whom you'll discuss what your working on and how it's going
- The objective of this is to get comfortable talking about your progress, issues you're running into, and your workflow

### Each person takes a turn to answer the following questions:

1.  What did you do yesterday?
2.  What will you do today?
3.  Anything blocking your progress?

<h2>Preparation Activity: Moodboard</h2>
- Time: 15 minutes
- Goal: Create a moodboard to document 3 variations of each of these elements
	- you can choose different elements, but they have to be elements that are used repeatedly
- Constraint: Each variation must be **structurally distinct** featuring different layouts (not just minor changes like color)
- Tool: This activity must be done in Figjam

### Elements to Document

- Buttons
- Cards
- Navbars (desktop or mobile)

### Outcome

- You will have a moodboard with elements to model your own components on

<h2>Creating Figma Components</h2>

### Benefits of making components

- They are reusable
- You have a master component to make edits to (instead of editing each instance)
- You can create variants of the component
- They make your design **maintainable**

### Downsides to making components

- It's a new skill that takes time to get used too
- You can overthink your component strategy and making things more complicated than necessary
- They might not be necessary for smaller designs

### Types of elements that you should componentize in Figma

- Buttons
- Icons
- Formatted Headings
- Cards
- Footer
- Navigation Bar

<h2>Make a Button</h2>
- Time: 15 minutes
- Following the documentation, create a reusable button component based on the ones in your moodboard.
- Make variants if you finish early

---

<h2>Lab Time</h2>

### Create components based on your moodboard design

- Make sure to test the sizes on things so that they fit on a relevant sized frame (ie: don't have a 1200px wide card for a 1280px wide screen)
- Make a medium resolution mockup using your components and Added Headings
- **Reflect on visual hierarchy and usability principles while designing**
- Optimize when you think it's ready

**Recommendation:** Don't just make 1 card for your assignment and finish. Try making and applying a few components to get a hang of the workflow.
