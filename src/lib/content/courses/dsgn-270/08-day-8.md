<h2> Teams Standups</h2>

- In each block of dsgn-270, you'll have a group of 3-4 with whom you'll discuss what your working on and how it's going
- The objective of this is to get comfortable talking about your progress, issues you're running into, and your workflow

### Each person takes a turn to answer the following questions:

1.  What did you do yesterday?
2.  What will you do today?
3.  Anything blocking your progress?

<h2>Design Assets</h2>

While not necessary, it's a good idea to set up your design assets like colors and fonts prior to building components. This allows you to make stylistic changes globally with little effort.

### [Set up Colors, Fonts, and Grids](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038746534-Create-color-text-effect-and-layout-grid-styles)

#### Colors

- Remember from our earlier classes of color selection (these are some suggestions to work from): - 1 primary color: the main theme of the site (a good option for having 3+ shades) - 1 secondary color: a complementary color (also good for having 3+ shades) - 1 accent color: used for buttons, hover, interactions (this color should be clear on your theme colors)

#### Activity: Use a Plugin to Generate Colors and Fonts

- Search the figma community plugins for a color generator
- Generate a couple colors

<h2>In Class Design Along</h2>

I will go step by step (following the steps below) to make a small high fidelity navbar, hero section, and 3 card layout. The goal is for everyone to be able to design along with me and ask questions as we go.

<h2>Hi Fidelity Mockup Steps</h2>

1. Prep your design assets first (only uses colors and fonts from your defined styles)
2. Set up your grid on the main frame (used for creating the layout)
3. Sketch out a wireframe to follow
4. Get image and icon assets
5. Start Designing
6. When Finished, review labels and groupings --> Optimize

**Good Luck**

<h2>Lab Time</h2>
- Add to the mockup that we made in class (add to it, tweak it etc)
- Create a new hi fidelity mockup
