<h2>Code Editor: VS Code</h2>

Most of your time in this program will be spent in your code editor. If you haven't installed one yet, VS Code is the current industry favourite:

- [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

If you've been using one you like, stick with it! Your instructors will be using VS Code.

### Configuration
In the User Settings, make the following changes:
- Set `Editor: Tab Size` to `2`
- Set `Editor: Word Wrap` to `on`

### Recommended Extensions
The following VS Code extensions will make you look cool in front of nerds:
- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
    - Allows you to open vanilla HTML websites in the browser using a local web server.
- [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

<h2>Git</h2>

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) will be a large component of this program for managing, sharing and deploying our source code.

- [Binary Installer for PC](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- [Binary Installer for Mac](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/) (or find an [alternate method](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) if you're feeling fancy)

<h2>GitHub</h2>
GitHub is a private corporation (now owned by Microsoft) that has built a world-leading community around Git. All sample code and projects will be hosted on GH and this program website is hosted using Git.

1. [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/) if you haven't already. **Don't forget:** your GH username will be seen by potential employers.
2. _Watch_ and/or _Star_ the [program repository](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/fall-2023).
3. Sign up for GitHub Classroom to get your [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) (handy free stuff)!

<h2>Slack for messaging</h2>

Slack is the preferred messaging tool for this program and is a popular tool in industry. You should see an invite to the SAIT WBDV Slack team sometime during orientation day.

- Optional: [Install Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/downloads/) (web version available)
- Tutorials: [Slack 101](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/resources/slack-101)

Note: The past cohorts of this program also have access to this Slack team but each cohort has a private channel. You're free to meet and interact with past students of this program. You may also use MS Teams if you'd like to avoid outside students (and your instructor(s)).

<h2>Firefox Browser</h2>

Regardless of which browser you prefer in your off-time, this course requires Firefox for its superior (for the moment) CSS Developer Tools. Chrome can be used for its Javascript Dev Tools in CPNT 262.

- [Install Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/)

The Mozilla Developer Network (the makers of Firefox) recently launched an entire [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh5UlGiu9d6LegIeUCW4N1w) to teach developers how to use Firefox Developer Tools (your best friend).
