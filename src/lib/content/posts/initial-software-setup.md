<h2>Zoom for video</h2>
We will be running most meetings in Zoom for this program. 

- [Create Zoom Account](https://zoom.us/signup)
- [Install Zoom](https://zoom.us/download)

All participants will need to be signed in to take part in the daily streams.

---

<h2>Slack for messaging</h2>
Slack is the preferred messaging tool for this program and is a popular tool in industry. You should see an invite to the SAIT WBDV Slack team sometime during orientation day.

- Optional: [Install Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/downloads/) (web version available)
- Tutorials: [Slack 101](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/resources/slack-101)

Note: The past two cohorts of this program also have access to this Slack team but each cohort has a private channel. You're free to meet and interact with past students of this program. You may also use MS Teams if you'd like to avoid outside students (and your instructor(s)). 

Tony also runs a public Discord server where you can find help from local developers:

- [Pixels YYC Discord Invite](https://discord.gg/Fg6DwHUmGZ)
- [Calgary Dev Community](https://discord.gg/XbnjJjzpmG) (started by the fall-2021 cohort)

<h2>Development Browser</h2>
Regardless of which browser you prefer in your off-time, this course requires Firefox Developer for its superior (for the moment) CSS Developer Tools. Chrome can be optionally used for its Javascript Dev Tools in CPNT 262.

- [Install Firefox Developer Edition](https://nightly.mozilla.org/)

The Mozilla Developer Network (the makers of Firefox) recently launched an entire [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh5UlGiu9d6LegIeUCW4N1w) to teach developers how to use Firefox Developer Tools (your best friend).

<h2>Codepen</h2>
The beginning of CPNT 260 (HTML/CSS) will be coded in the browser before we move to VS Code (see below). Codepen is a "sandbox" environment that will serve as part of your portfolio when you dive into the real world.

- [Create a free Codepen Account](https://codepen.io/): **Don't forget** - your Codepen username will be seen by potential employers.

---

<h2>Code Editor</h2>
Most of your time in this program will be spent in your code editor. If you haven't installed one yet, VS Code is the current industry favourite:

- [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

If you've been using one you like, stick with it! Your instructors will be using VS Code.

---

<h2>Git</h2>
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) will be a large component of this program for managing, sharing and deploying our source code.

- [Binary Installer for PC](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- [Binary Installer for Mac](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/) (or find an [alternate method](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) if you're feeling fancy)

For the adventurous, see this [Git Reference](https://padlet.com/acidtone/git_github), which will be the topic of [CPNT 201 Day 2].

---

<h2>GitHub</h2>
GitHub is a private corporation (now owned by Microsoft) that has built a world-leading community around Git. All sample code and projects will be hosted on GH and the program website is hosted using [GH Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

1. [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/) if you haven't already. **Don't forget:** your GH username will be seen by potential employers.
2. _Watch_ and/or _Star_ the [program repository](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/winter-2022).
3. Sign up for GitHub Classroom to get your [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) (handy free stuff)!

<h2>Figma</h2>
DSGN 270 will involve a lot of Figma. Rumour has that SAIT students and instructors get extra stuff if you sign up with your SAIT email address. We haven't tested this...
