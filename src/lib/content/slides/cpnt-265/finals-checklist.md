## Final Week Checklist
### Time to polish

---

## Profile consistency
- Decide which social sites you will be using for your professional work.
- Pick an avatar (i.e. profile pic) and use it on all your these socials: GitHub, Codepen, LinkedIn, etc.
- When possible, cross link your socials. For example: fill out "Profile Links" in your Codepen Profile. 

---

## GitHub/Codepen/etc
- Repo cleaning: Set unneeded repos to Private.
- Repo polish: Comment and refactor any repos that stay public.
- Repo naming: Rename past assignments that will remain public. 
    - Ex: `cpnt260-a3` -> `sample-gallery`

## Personal/Porfolio website
- What will you use for your primary website?
    - Github/Codepen/whatever works if you don't have one.
- Will you use a custom domain?
- Have you listed this on your Socials?
