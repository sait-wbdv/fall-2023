## Contracting as a Developer
### Tony's unofficial advice

---

## Finding clients
1. Friends and family
    - Tony's first website: [His Step-mom's](http://clairescott.com/).
2. Job boards (see [Pixels Job Board](https://pixelsyyc.com/))
    - Tony's first paying gig: U of C Job Board
3. Client word-of-mouth
    - Tony's next five clients came from referrals
4. Networking (not necessarily networking events)

---

### Key Goal
## Client Expectation management
- Under-promise and over-perform
- Educate the client about "tech debt"
- Battle scope creep by saying no
- Document meetings and phone calls

---

## Sole proprietorships
You don't have to incorporate to operate under a business name:
1. Register a [NUANS](https://www.nuans.com/site/nuans-corporate-name-trademark-reports/en) tradename at a Registry
2. Open a business bank account with tradename
3. Give the tradename registration to your accountant when making a Statement of Business Income on your taxes

See [this Padlet](https://padlet.com/acidtone/friday-night-pints-contracting-as-software-developer-u3zotj3bww2kk1dd) for common questions and answers from a past event that Tony hosted.

## It's not all your money!
Money you receive by invoice isn't all yours.
- You still have to pay tax on that income, minus write-offs
- You have to pay back any GST you charged on your invoices
- Tony's recommendation: Set aside about 1/3rd of all invoice income just to be safe 

---

## Signing the client
Every scenario is different but most have the following steps:
1. **First Contact**: First-time meeting
2. **Romance**: Figuring out if you're the right fit
3. **Non-disclosure Agreement**: Often required for deeper discussions (can be Step 1 or 2) 
    - [Sample NDA](../../assets/files/NDA.pdf) (have this vetted by a lawyer)
4. **"Sign" the client**: Often called a Statement of Work but can be an email agreement

---

### Important
## Talk to a Lawyer
- Tony's not a lawyer. Don't trust anything he says.
- Tony uses [Good Lawyer](https://www.goodlawyer.ca/) for contract reviews and consultations.

---

### How are you getting paid?
- Time and materials (by the hour)
- Fixed quote with installments
- Retainer
- Product

---

### Time and materials
Tony recommends this for beginners
- Client is charged by the hour
- Track time in 15 increments
- Invoice monthly (or every two weeks)
- Offer hour quota if client is hesitant
- Be explicit in the agreement: "This is not a fixed quote."
- Cannot charge for invoicing or learning time
- Use invoicing software. Tony uses [Freshbooks](https://www.freshbooks.com/) (it's pricey but there are many alternatives)

---

### Fixed quote with installments
- Not Tony's favourite method
- Ask for at least 25% up front.
- Schedule installments when phases are "complete"
- Weigh the installments so you're at least 75% paid by the time the website is ready for launch

---

### Retainer
- Paid up-front for a set amount of hours
- Not well suited for development 
- Great for regular content updates and maintenance

---

### Product
- Paying a set price for a defined product or set of features
- Examples
  - Software packages
  - Software as a service
  - Client training

---

## Questions to ask the client
### (Not an exhaustive list)

---

### Is this a new or existing project?
- What's the history of the project?
- What's the purpose of the project?
- Who are the Stakeholders?

---

### Existing (Legacy) Projects

---

### Who is currently working on the project?
- Who originally developed it?
- Are they still there? Is there drama?
- Who is the project lead?

---

### What do they need? Where do you fit in?
- Be honest with your skills but...
- Don't sell yourself short
- Do you know any colleagues/mentors that can help?

---

### Where is the Production server hosted?
- Are they using a password manager?
    - If not, recommend a password manager?
- What credentials are needed to access the website?
    - Web server
    - Git repos
    - Database server
    - etc

---

### Does the client have Analytics installed?
- Get access to the Google Analytics
- Use the Content Drilldown to learn which site content is most popular.
- What is the Audience
  - What percentage is mobile traffic?
  - What is the browser share?

---

### New (Greenfield) Projects

---

### Is the site replacing a legacy site? If yes:
- Is there a database?
- How many users are there? How much traffic?
- Are there any hard deadlines?
- Is the host changing?

---

### Where is the Production site going to be hosted?
- **Hosted**: i.e. with Media Temple, Hostgator, AWS, Azure, etc
  - make sure host has good support
- **On-premise** (rare): hosted on site with the client
  - only allow this if the client has an IT department (could be one person)

---

### Where is the Staging (development) server going to be hosted?
- Does the current host have cheap/free staging servers available (preferred)?
- If the servers are different, when how will the site be migrated?
- Who's credit card will be on the account?
    - Client pays directly?
    - Developer expenses to client?
