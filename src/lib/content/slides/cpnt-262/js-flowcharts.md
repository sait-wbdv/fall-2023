## Example Flowchart
![Start-Stop symbol](/images/flowchart/flowchart-example.png)
---

## Start/End
![Start-Stop symbol](/images/flowchart/start-stop.png)
- Shape is a rounded rectangle;
- Start is required and should always be the same;
- Start always should be the first block;
- Flowchart may have no End or multiple Ends.

---

## Process
![Start-Stop symbol](/images/flowchart/process.png)
- Shape is a rectangle;
- Involves a single action or verb in the flowchart.

---

## Input/Output
![Start-Stop symbol](/images/flowchart/input-output.png)
- Shape is a parallelogram;
- Indicates a manual operation is needed.            

---

## Decision
![Start-Stop symbol](/images/flowchart/decision.png)
- Shape is a rhombus or diamond;
- Outcome is a Yes or No;
- In general: Yes should go left-right and No should go down.

---

## Sub-process
![Start-Stop symbol](/images/flowchart/sub-process.png)
- Indicate an independent process with its own Start and End;
- In programs, this is often a separate function.

---

## Arrow
![Start-Stop symbol](/images/flowchart/arrow.png)
- Indicate the flow of the chart;
- Are drawn from the output of one symbol to the input of another;
- Only one arrow can represent an output;
- Multiple arrows can represent inputs.

## Questions to ask
- What's the purpose of the flowchart?
    - Test an idea?
    - Communication with a team?
    - Project documentation?
    - Understanding of a large system?
- Where do you start?
- What is the final output of the process, system or task?
- What's trivial enough to not be included in the flowchart?
