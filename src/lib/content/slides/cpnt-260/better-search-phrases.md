## Terminology
<dl>
  <dt>Normie</dt>
  <dd>Someone whose tastes, lifestyle, habits, and attitude are mainstream in a particular field or topic.</dd>
  <dt>Expert/Superstar/Hotshot</dt>
  <dd>Someone who is dazzlingly skilled or knowledgeable in a particular field or topic.</dd>
  <dt>Jargon</dt>
  <dd>Special words or expressions that are used by a particular profession or group and are difficult for others to understand.</dd>
</dl>
---

## What makes you so special?
### (Seriously)
Think of a topic/field/profession in which:
- you would consider yourself an expert;
- your classmates would probably consider themselves a "normie";
- you can dazzle most others with jargon they wouldn't understand.

You will be sharing this topic in a group discussion later.

---

## Why is search important?
- Your learning will live and die on your ability to find high quality resources;
- There's always a new tool/technology/framework to learn (and also someone to teach it);
- It's rare that a problem hasn't already been solved (and shared) by someone else;
- Devs are lazy and don't want to memorize anything.

---

## Why is search difficult?
- High quality search results require high quality search terms;
- You won't know these terms as a beginner;
- Resources become outdated quickly.

---

### Quality Searches
Effective search phrases are usually:
1. **Concise**: Normally 1-4 words long
    - _Exception_: Copy/pasting an error
2. **Domain-specific**: Terms that are used within a specific industry and not in general usage by "normies"
3. **Qualified**: Qualifying terms further filter the results based on:
    - the skill level of the searcher
    - the specific goal of the searcher
    - a desired source of information

---

## Concise search phrases
### Less is more
- The more words you use, the more you dilute meaning;
- Typing is tedious, do less of it;
- All you need is that perfect word, but first you need to find it...

## Nerdier terms
#### (Use with caution)
Folder &#8594; directory &#8594; project root &#8594; repository &#8594; repo

Photo &#8594; image &#8594; high-frequency raster image

Web address &#8594; URL &#8594; Top-level domain &#8594; TLD

---

## Activity: What's your jargon?
In groups of 3 or 4, and taking turns:
1. Share an obscure hobby/topic/profession/etc with the group;
2. For the **normies**: 
    - What terms do you know about the domain?
3. For the **expert**:
    - What domain-specific terms you can teach?
4. Did anyone find a new friend to nerd out with?

---

## Qualifying terms
A domain-specific term will still return many results that might not be focused enough to solve your problem:
- Looking for tutorials?
    ```html
    node for beginners
    node getting started
    node examples
    ```
- Use nerdy terms for nerdy results. Are the results different between these terms?
    ```html
    css docs
    css specs
    ```

---

## Example Searches
How would you rate the following search phrases?
- Were any words specific to the industry of web development? What are they?
- How many words are used?
- What is the skill level of the searcher? What problem might they be solving?
- How would do you identify high quality results?

---

## "`How do I build a web site?`"

---

## "`Why isn't my CSS doing anything?`"

---

## "`web development`"

---

## "`html crash course`"

---

## "`js architecture patterns`"

---

## "`[your fave browser] devtools`"

---

## "`most underrated string methods`"

---

## Identifying high quality results
Good resources:
- Are current (does the resource have a date?);
- Provide sample code;
- Have video chapter markers;
- Come from a trusted source;
    - **Pro-tip**: prepend your favourite content creator to find results from that person/site:
        ```
        mdn fat arrow
        ```
- Are easy to find again. What search term would you use to find a favourite result in the future?

---

### Convergent vs Divergent Searching
- **Convergent**: 
    - There is probably **one** answer to your problem
    - Example: 
        - _What's the forecast for tomorrow?_
- **Divergent**: 
    - There could be **many** answers to your problem
    - You're doing general research
    - Example: 
        - _What's an alternative to Netflix?_
        - _Finding inspiration for a logo design_

---

## Divergent searches
### with Suggestions
![Screencap - Search why](/images/misc/search-why.png)

---

## Google (or whatever) Suggestions
1. Enter a domain-specific term in your search bar but _DON'T_ hit enter:
    ```
    js loop
    ```
2. Wait for Google to show completion suggestions
    ![Example of a Suggestion search](/images/misc/divergent-search.png)
3. Pick a Suggestion to learn something new about that concept.

---

## "Verses" searches
![Screencap - Search js function](/images/misc/search-vscode-vs.png)

- Add "vs" after a tool, concept, term.
- Dig deeper by "verses searching" each of the suggested terms

---

### Activities: Divergent searching
- Use Suggestions to find a new domain-specific term you didn't know before;
- Try "verses" searches to find alternative to a tool you use everyday.
