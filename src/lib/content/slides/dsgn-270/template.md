### Example Searches
How would you rate the following search phrases?
- Were any words specific to the industry of web development? What are they?
- How many words are used?
- What is the skill level of the searcher? What problem might they be solving?
- How would do you identify high quality results?

---

## "`How do I build a web site?`"
- Could be better.
- It's not domain-specific.
- It's kind of long.
- Skill level: probably beginner

---

## "`Why isn't my CSS doing anything?`"
- One star.
- Probably too long.
- There's no way for Google to answer the question, but it seems to anyway?


---

## "`web development`"
- Not very domain-specific
- Not qualified; there are a lot reasons why someone would use this phrase 

---

## "`html crash course`"
- Pretty good
- Domain specific and qualified
- Skill level: beginner

---

## "`css patterns`"
- "pattern" is one of Tony's favourite words to append to a phrase for nerdy results.

---

## "`[your fave browser] devtools`"
- The term "devtools" is (mostly) only used by frontend developers (domain-specific)

---

## "`most underrated css properties`"
- The "css" in "css properties" makes "properties" waaaaay more domain-specific

---

## Identifying high quality results
Look for search results that:
- Fit your learning style
- Solve your problem
- Have imagery and high visual hierarchy
- Are current
- Come from a trusted source

---

## Convergent vs Divergent Searching
- **Convergent**: 
    - There is probably one answer to your problem
    - Example: copy/pasting an error
- **Divergent**: 
    - There could be many answers to your problem
    - You don't have a problem
    - Example: finding an alternative to Codepen using Google Suggestions

---

## "`codepen vs`"
- Wait for Google to show completion suggestions
- What other alternatives can you find using a similar "verses search"?
