How we make information easy to access

---

### Terminology

- Usability : A quality attribute that assesses how easy user interfaces are to use. The word "usability" also refers to methods for improving ease-of-use during the design process.
- Information Hierarchy : A discipline that focuses on organizing, structuring, and labeling content in an effective and sustainable way.
- Satisfice : When a user chooses the first reasonable option instead of the best option.
- Interaction Cost : The sum of efforts — mental and physical — that the users must deploy in interacting with a site in order to reach their goals.

### Satisficing

Unless faced with life-changing information, most site visitors won't read all of the content provided but settle for a “good-enough” answer. Better sorting and clearer writing satisfy users without exhausting the limited time they’re willing to spend on a website.
