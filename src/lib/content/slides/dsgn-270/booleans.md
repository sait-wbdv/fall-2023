# Boolean Operations

Manipulate objects
  
---

## 1. Union

- Union combines the selected shapes into a boolean group. 
- If the objects overlap, the new shapes outer path consists of the composite of its sublayersâ€™ paths minus any segments that overlap. 
- The stroke would then be applied to that outer path ignoring any path segments which overlap each other.
---

## 2. Subtract
- Subtract is the opposite of Union.
- Subtract removes the area of a shape or set of shapes from a base shape. 
- Only the bottom shape layer is solid, the rest are subtracted from it.
---

## 3. Intersect 

- Inersect creates a boolean group whose shape consists only of the overlapping parts of its sublayers.

---

### Exclude

- Exclude is the opposite of Intersect
- Eclude shows only the areas of it's sublayers that **do not** overlap
