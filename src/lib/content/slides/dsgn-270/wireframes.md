# Wireframes, User Flows, Mockups

## Mockups and Wireframes

- Mockups show a medium to high resolution of what the website or app will look like.
- Wireframes are the skeletons of mockups
  - they are low resolution and communicate the essential layout and usability elements

## How to use wireframes and mockups together

- Test ideas with wireframing, and when you've worked out the bugs, begin the mockup process
  - This workflow allows you to create quickly and not get hung up on irrelevant details at any given point of your design process
  - Reworking a wireframe takes very little effort compared to a high res mockup, or a completed site or app.

## Common types of Wireframing

- User Flows: Document the steps a user will work through with cards (not a wireframe in the traditional sense, but these are a useful step in the wireframe process)
- UI Wireframe: Map out the page content with basic shapes and labels

## User Flows

- Useful get into the mind of the user
  - Map out steps from the user's perspective)
- Also useful for reducing a site down to it's core functionality to find issues with the design
  - Can be doing prior to design or as a review of a site to determine where usability bugs lie

- Pen and Paper sketch
- Using basic shapes in figma
- Plan out a design
