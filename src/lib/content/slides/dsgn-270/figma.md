## 2. What to expect from Figma

- Figma is a UX focused design tool that specializes in vector Editing
- It has less features than Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator because it's meant for basic shape manipulations
  - Use Inkscape or Illustrator for advanced svg and vector editing work
  - Use Gimp or Adobe Photoshop for raster image editing work (rasters are images like pictures)
- Figma is similar to Penpot or Adobe XD. They all have less path manipulation tools but feature prototyping and UI design focused tools
