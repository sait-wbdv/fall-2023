## What a Design System Does
- sets standards for how things should look
- reduces cognitive load when making design decisions
- allows quite deployment of new designs via the system's library and preconfigured components

- Large companies like Google and Apple have comprehensive design Systems
- Smaller firms may have less comprehensive or documented systems, or use standards set by other organizations
