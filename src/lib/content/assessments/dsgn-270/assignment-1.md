<h2> Scenario</h2>

You are starting out a new web development project and need to do some initial planning on what the look and feel of the site is going to be. Your client (client could be yourself) was very vague with their description of the design of their site and they did not give you any specific colors, fonts, or ui ideas.

Your job is to build a mood board based on a vague description (which you will define yourself). The mood board is used to gather examples and ideas organically. Add structure and group content with notes so that you or a hypothetical colleague could look at this later and understand it.

### Content To Gather on your Moodboard

- 2 Color palettes (3-5 colors per palette)
  - include shades of white and black
  - 1 primary, 1 secondary color 
- Typography (2-3 type faces per group)
  - should be chosen by you
- Screenshots of user interface (ui) elements on at least 2 websites
  - headers and hero sections
  - navigation
  - lists
  - cards
  - call to action

### Resources

- [UI Patterns](https://ui-patterns.com/): Examples and descriptions of specific ui elements
- [Material Design Manual](https://material.io/): Google's Material Design Guide contains examples of UI elements that you can look for
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

## Instructions

1. Create a mood board in Figjam and add the vague description to the top of the board in large text
2. Set up areas in your moodboard for grouping the required content
3. Add content to the moodboard
   - See the **rubric** for how many variations are needed of each content type
   - Images of websites should be clickable links so that you can navigate back to the original site when needed
4. Add brief sticky notes to your moodboard as makes sense to you, there needs to be a minimum of 1 note per content type (8 sticky notes minimum)
5. Export your mood board as a png or pdf
   - make sure that the export file opens and is easy to read
6. Follow Submission guidelines below
