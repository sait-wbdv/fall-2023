<h2>Scenario</h2>

You have finished the design asset gathering and mood boarding phase for a website, but need to draft the layout so that specific images, text, and links cant be organized.

While most of the text content and specific images haven't been chosen, it's necessary to get a minimal layout established.

Your objective is to sketch the desktop layouts for 4 pages on a website. You can choose which pages the site contains. If you're unsure of what to do, create: home page, about page, products/services page, contact page.

**NOTE: If you would like to design an app instead of website, please contact me to discuss content variations**

- Each page should have a minimum of 2 sections of content excluding the navbar and footer.
  - A section requires a heading and content (text, images, cta...)
  - Add labels that clearly identify the purpose of each section. ie: "introduce brand", "showcase popular products", "demonstrate features"
  - Section headings should have actual working titles
  - Buttons and links should have user focused functional text
    - instead of "link" - "shop" or "read more"
  - paragraph text can be represented with lorem ipsum or swiggly lines
  - images are represented as boxes with an x going from corner to corner
- Navigation bar
  - working titles for the 4 pages
  - circle to show logo position
  - 1 extra feature (ie: socials, contact link, dark mode toggle)

  - copyright layout (can be squiggles)
  - general layout of footer content (nav etc)
