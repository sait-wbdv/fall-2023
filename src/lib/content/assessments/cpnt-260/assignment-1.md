title: Assignment 1 - Text Column
type: assignment
points: 10
---

In this assignment, you will be creating a column of body text with HTML and CSS. **The content should be original.** While you can use open-source content as inspiration, it should be unique and on-topic.

## Content Topic
Your content may cover any topic of your choice and does not have to relate to a real-life scenario. 

For example, you may write:
- your own bio for your portfolio website;
- a fictional (very) short story;
- a how-to article on your favourite hobby;
- a review of a book/movie/article/hiking trail;
- an About page for a hypothetical client website;
- a entry for your coding journal,
- etc, etc.

The content should make sense and be of potential value to the (hypothetical) reader.

## Instructions and Rubric
1. Write at least 200 words on your topic;
2. Use valid HTML and CSS to make a column of [flow content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories#flow_content);
3. Place your content in a validated HTML file named `index.html` that's linked to an external stylesheet.

**Each of the following requirements will be worth 2 points** for a total of 10 points. 

### HTML Content
Enhance the visual hierarchy of your content using (at least):
- [ ] One level 1 heading and one level 2 heading;
- [ ] One paragraph;
- [ ] An ordered or unordered list;
- [ ] One link to an internal or external location with a hover state;
- [ ] One example of bold text;
- [ ] One example of italic text.


### Responsiveness and Accessibility
Your content should be responsive and accessible to screen readers:
- [ ] No horizontal scroll bars should be visible at any device screen width;
- [ ] Line length should not exceed 85 characters on wide screens;
- [ ] Content should be centred on wide screens (unless it looks great, otherwise);
- [ ] Content should be at least `1rem` away from the edge of the screen;
- [ ] Content should be wrapped in a `main` element;
- [ ] Text should have at least a AA contrast ratio rating for its size.

### Typography
Enhance the visual hierarchy and readability of your typography:
- [ ] Choose specific (i.e. not just `serif` and `sans-serif`) and suitable Display and Text Typefaces that are different enough to distinguish headings from body text;
- [ ] Google Fonts for your typefaces, defined with proper system and generic fallbacks;
- [ ] The font size of your text should be larger than the browser default but should still be readable on mobile devices;
- [ ] The line height of your body text should be larger than the browser default but still be readable;

### Above and Beyond
Show off your coding skills by using THREE of the following:
- A nested list, OR;
- An image, that is not distorted and does not hurt page usability, OR;
- An icon font, OR; 
- A definition list, OR;
- Get fancy: Add more visual hierarchy to your headings with each of the following "fancy" declarations:
    - [`font-variant`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-variant): Used for setting small caps;
    - [`letter-spacing`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/letter-spacing): Great for spacing letters in headings, OR;
- Responsive text using [`clamp()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp), OR;
- Customize your list styling.

Provide a clear indication of which options you've chosen in your README (see below):
- Which did you choose?
- What file(s) and line number(s) can it be found?

### Documentation and Code Quality
- Include a `README.md` in your project that contains the following information:
  - Course title;
  - Assignment name;
  - Author name;
  - A link to the GH Pages site
- **Important**: Any attributions for code and/or assets you used that are not your own.
- Use best practices with file/directory names and indentation:
  - 2 spaces per indent
  - See: [Files and Directories - Naming Conventions](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/d77059ec1851eff266339a3df70f6984)
- CSS declarations should be organized by category (box model, fonts, borders, flex, etc), separated by a space and commented.
