title: Final Group Project - Blog Website
type: assignment
points: 45
---

In this group assignment, you will work with your classmates to create a database-driven blog that features a GUI CMS.

This can be on any topic though I recommend to do it as a tech blog (focus on writing content that you can present on in 265). The ideas don't need to be novel, but should be meaningful. You can write tutorials, opinion pieces, explanations, reviews... whatever is relevant to you. If you're at a loss for content, think about major ah-ha moment's that you've had during the semester.

**Grading**:

- Group mark: 40 points
- Peer evaluation: 5 points

### Group Charter (GH Project)

To facilitate group communication and transparency, submit a [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/features/issues) with the following:

1. Board README listing Team members and general roles and responsibilities;

At least two or three board cards converted to [Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) and [Assigned](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users) to each team member that (as a group) each of you have committed to completing;
