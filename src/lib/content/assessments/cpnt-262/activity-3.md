<h2>Overview</h2>

In this activity, we will develop our understanding of how to use objects and arrays effectively. You will need to create an array and an object and render content from them by using their respective methods.

You will **not** need to render the content in HTML or deploy to github pages for this; however, you will need to import the client.js file into the index.html file.

<h2>Instructions</h2>

1. Create a new github repo
2. Inside it there should be 3 files:
   - index.html
   - client.js
   - README.md
3. Set up your HTML file and import the `client.js` file in the head tag with a defer attribute added
4. Add and console.log() values from your object and array methods
5. In your comments, note whether or not the method used **mutates** the original variable

### Display and/or modify your array with 3 of the following methods

- Add to an array using the `.push()` or `.unshift() method
- Remove from an array using the `.pop()` or `.shift()` method
- Merge two arrays together with `.concat()`
- Return a portion of an array with `.slice()` or `.splice()`
- Return only specific elements of an array with `.filter()` or `.find()`
- Verify if elements exist in an array with `.includes()`, .`every()`, or `.some()`

### Display and/or modify your object with 3 of the following methods

- Create and log an array of the values of your object with `Object.values()`
- Create and log an array of all the keys of your object with `Object.keys()`
- Create a nested array from your object by using `Object.entries()`
- Reduce an object's editability with `Object.freeze()` or `Object.seal()`
- Create a new object with the `new Object()` syntax
- remove a key-value pair from an object with the `delete` keyword

<h2>Submission Instructions</h2>

1. As a comment in D2L: share links to make it easy for the instructor to quickly evaluate your work:
   - GH repos, Pages, Projects (Beta), etc.
   - Codepens, Figma, FigJam, etc.
2. Double check the Activity for specific instructions.
3. If applicable, include a README containing the following;
   - Activity name and author;
   - Attributions: Did anyone help you? Give credit to any classmates, articles, tutorials, etc that helped you complete this project.
   - Include self-assessments, observations, research, etc under the heading “Code Journal” in your README.
4. Zip project repo and submit it.
