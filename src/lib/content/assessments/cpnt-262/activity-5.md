## Outline

Learning to scaffold and configure a project can be a complex process and involve some different steps between the dependencies. This activity gives you a space to practice scaffolding an application.

_scaffolding is the initial setup of a project, laying the foundations_

## Instructions

- There are 2 ways to start this activity:

1. (easier) Follow the [skeletonUI CLI instructions](https://www.skeleton.dev/docs/get-started) to scaffold a sveltekit app with skeletonUI
2. (harder) Follow the [manual skeletonUI install instructions](https://www.skeleton.dev/docs/get-started) to scaffolde a sveltekit app and apply skeletonUI

- After scaffolding the app, test that it works by using the command: `npm run dev` (make sure you're in the right directory when you run the command)
- Commit to github (it's good to do this after an initial scaffold in case you need to go back and make changes)
- Add [prettier](https://github.com/sveltejs/prettier-plugin-svelte)
- Add the [iconify icon library](https://iconify.design/docs/icon-components/svelte/)
- Verify that the icons work by rendering one on the homepage of the app
