excerpt: Learn how to make variables in javascript and render them on an html page
points: 5
type: assignment

<h2>Overview</h2>

This activity is designed for you to demonstrate your knowledge of javascript variables and primitive data types.

The objective is to render a series of string and number variables on an html page. However to do so, you will be using built in string and number methods to modify the values. You will also need to show the difference between `const` and `let` by reassigning.

_No CSS is necessary for this assignment, however you will be using JS and HTML_

###

<h2>Instructions</h2>

1. Create a new github repo
2. Inside it there should be 3 files:
   - index.html
   - client.js
   - README.md
3. Set up your HTML file and import the `client.js` file in the head tag with a defer attribute added
4. **Main Task** Code your number and string methods and organize your client.js file with comments
5. Use either `document.querySelector()` or `document.getElementById()` and any appropriate methods to render your javascript variables onto the html page
6. Use headings in the html file to identify what each value is (these should relate to the comments in your js file)
7. Deploy to Github Pages

### Content

- Label and render the "Before" values
  - there will be 1 string and 1 number
- Label and render the "After" values
  - There will be 6 values total in this section

**NOTE: This can be done in many ways, pick a layout that is easy to read and understand**

#### Display or modify your chosen number with three of the following:

- Increment or decrement a number using ++/--;
- Convert a number to a string with Number.toString();
- Convert a number to exponential notation with Number.toExponential();
- Convert a number to a string with a given number of decimals with Number.toFixed();
- Convert a number to a given number of floating point decimals with Number.toPrecision();
- Convert a number to a language-sensitive string representation with Number.toLocaleString()
- Convert a number or string to an integer with Number.parseInt()
- Convert a number or string to a floating point number with Number.parseFloat()
- Check if a number is an integer with Number.isInteger()
- Check if a “number” is actually a number with Number.isNaN()
- Check if a number is finite with Number.isFinite()

#### Display or modify your chosen string with three of the following:

- Show the number of characters in your string with String.length;
- Show a sub-string of your string with String.substr() or String.substring();
- Show a sub-string of your string with String.slice();
- Show the first character of your string;
- Show the last character of your string;
- Show the first index of a word that can be found in your string with String.indexOf();
- Replace a word or phrase in your string with a new word or phrase using String.replace() or String.replaceAll();
- Concatenate two strings with String.concat();
- Use String.startsWith() to show if your string starts with a word of your choice;
- Use String.endsWith() to show if your string starts with a word of your choice;
- Use String.includes() to show if a substring is present in your string;
