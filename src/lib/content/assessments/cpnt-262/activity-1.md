<h2>Overview</h2>

The goal of this activity is to familiarize with basic programming concepts by using a visual building block style programming language called Scratch. This will be the only Scratch based activity in this program and will serve as a metaphor for learning Javascript.

You are welcome to build any type of project that Scratch allows. Common choices are: - Interactivty story - Game - Animation - Music video

<h2>Instructions</h2>

Create a project in scratch as noted above with the following requirements satisfied.

### Project Requirements

- Use at least 2 sprites (neither can be the Scratch cat)
- At least 3 scripts (in total)
- At least 1 conditional
- At least 1 loop
- At least 1 variable
- Use at least 1 custom block that takes an input

#### **NOTE**: You should use a few dozen puzzle pieces overall to achieve these requirements successfully

### Code Quality

- The code works and the output (game/animation/story) is reasonably coherent
- Use custom blocks with clear descriptive names when sequences get too long (ie: containing multiple steps and actions that aren't actually dependent on one another)

<h2>Rubric</h2>

### 5 Points: Required Content Usage

- Required elements are present and logically used
- Block settings and content have been changed to make sense with the content
- Storyline is bigger than a simple hello world type example

### 5 Points: Code Quality

- Scripts run when expected
- If user input is required, it's clear when and how to do so
- Correct blocks are chosen for the use case
- Long scripts are broken up into custom blocks with descriptive names
