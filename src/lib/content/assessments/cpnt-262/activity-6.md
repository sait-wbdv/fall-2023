## Instructions

- Duplicate and rename your activity 5
- Using [skeletonUI](https://www.skeleton.dev/) components or your own html markup, create a page layout of your choosing
- Styling should be edited a little bit with tailwind css utility classes (1-5 classes in your layout is enough if you're using skeleton components)
- Add a `<slot />` for where the content will render
- Create a page that has a unique title on it
- Set the page to use your custom layout
