4. **Flowchart: _5 points_**

   - Submit a share link (Figma, LucidCharts, etc) in Brightspace.
5. **ER Diagram: _5 points_**

6. **Task Board: _1 point per feature (max 10 points)_**
   - Using GH Projects, Trello or similar task tracking tool:
     1. Optional: Create a "Final Project" repo for your tasks.
     2. Create a card representing a task you need to complete for your final project presentation. Put it in a _To Do_, _Backlog_ or similar list.
     3. To submit: Take screencap of project board and total your point for a single Brightspace submission.
   - A "Task" is loosely defined but it should be a non-trivial activity that brings you closer to your Final Project Presentation. Examples:
     - "Implement personal access token for _GitHub_ API"
     - "Create logic flowchart for sign-in process"
     - "Create image gallery from JSON data using fetch and a loop"
   - Tasks should be submitted in good faith: no cheesy tasks like "tie shoelaces".
