## Details

In this assignment, you will deploy three _distinct_ static website templates that could be customized for a fictitious business of your choice.

**Scenario**: You have landed a new client! They want to choose a template for their new website at the next meeting. You want to impress them with three that are:

- Deployed (i.e. published) on GH Pages
- Visually distinct with respect to UX/UI
- Customized with the company details
  - The name can be made up
  - Optional: A logo can be an icon from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) or similar source

## Instructions

1. Search online for three free, and _distinct_, static website templates that could be customized for your selected client;
2. Deploy each template to GH Pages, naming each repo "cpnt201-a1-[template-name]";
3. Make at least three customizations to _each_ template **as separate commits**.
   - At the end of this assignment, you should have made at least 12 commits; three for each of the three customizations, plus your initial commits (which are not counted for marks).

## Marking Rubric

This assignment will be marked out of 20 points.

### GitHub Setup: 4 points

1. Local name and email address should be set correctly in your Git config;
2. GitHub Profile should be updated with:
    - Profile photo
    - Bio
    - Location
    - Optional: LinkedIn, Twitter, etc

### Distinctiveness: 4 points

The three templates will collectively be scored on their visual distinctiveness and should offer a diverse choice for the client. They should:
- be visually distinct from the other two templates;
- represent, collectively, a wide variety of layout elements (cards, sliders, gallery, etc).
- be from different template authors (but they can be from the same marketplace).

### Each Template: 4 points (12 points total)

1. Deployment: **1 point**
   - Each template should be deployed using GitHub Pages (_not_ with a GH theme) and be viewable on a mobile device.
   - Your first commit should be the unmodified template with a commit message of "initial commit".
2. Committed Changes: **3 points** (1 point for each commit)
   - Each template repository should have at least three commits (in addition to your initial commit) that customizes content on the home page. For example:
     - page titles and headings (commit 1),
     - page logo/icon (commit 2),
     - primary navigation (commit 3).
   - Each change should be captured in its own commit with a descriptive message.
   - The **changes themselves will not be marked** but cannot break the design.
