## Coding help
For **coding help**, it's encouraged you (in this order):
1. Spend an honest amount of effort toward solving the problem yourself;
2. During class time: 
		- ask a question in Zoom!
		- Come to the Instructor's breakout room during Lab Time.
3. Outside of class time: 
		- Post a question in the `#winter-2023` or `general` channel on Slack;
4. Last resort: you can DM your instructor for coding help outside of class time but don't expect a response until next class.
