<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>You are starting out a new web development project and need to do some initial planning on what the look and feel of the site is going to be. Your client (client could be yourself) was very vague with their description of the design of their site and they did not give you any specific colors, fonts, or ui ideas.</p>
<p>Your job is to build a mood board based on a vague description (which you will define yourself). The mood board is used to gather examples and ideas organically. Add structure and group content with notes so that you or a hypothetical colleague could look at this later and understand it.</p>
